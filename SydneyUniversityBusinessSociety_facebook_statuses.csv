The venture was co-founded at Sydney University and Sydney remains the largest market to date. Students who have put effort into their notes can make easy money and also benefit from mentoring opportunities, job references and access to exclusive events and networking sessions with access to major commercial and legal firms.\n \nJoel will be providing unique end to end insight into how a successful project is run at a consulting firm, by breaking down the process and highlighting the various stages of preparing a deliverable.

This semester, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming to Sydney Uni and you could benefit in a big way. If you have written notes and received a Distinction or High Distinction for that subject, then simply upload them to the Nexus Notes site using the promo code: USYDBUSINESS \n\nYour notes will be approved by Nexus if they meet the quality criteria! Notes are sold for $35 per set \xe2\x80\x93 you receive 50% of this every time your notes sell. Those students in need of notes can see a 10% preview of the document, the grades the uploader received for that subject, along with the page number, year, and number of downloads. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple really. What about plagiarism you ask? Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got this covered. Firstly, they don\xe2\x80\x99t sell assignments, essays or take-home exams...just notes. Secondly, they've just had one of the best law firms in Australia (KWM) do their \nlegals. \n\nThey've also just teamed up with AIME so users can now donate their notes to charity. So, check out the site and get uploading! The first notes up there sell the most! Students from other unis have been known to make over $3,000 from their notes.
