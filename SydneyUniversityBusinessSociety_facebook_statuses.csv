The venture was co-founded at Sydney University and Sydney remains the largest market to date. Students who have put effort into their notes can make easy money and also benefit from mentoring opportunities, job references and access to exclusive events and networking sessions with access to major commercial and legal firms.\n \nJoel will be providing unique end to end insight into how a successful project is run at a consulting firm, by breaking down the process and highlighting the various stages of preparing a deliverable.
