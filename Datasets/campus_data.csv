Skip your vegan, gluten, sugar, fat and taste free brunch and come get a shot of some real vitamin sea. Because who needs a kale smoothie when the only shake you’ll be doing is with your booty. 

Put on some Go Go boots, grease up your hair, rediscover your mojo and get into the 70s flair.

‘Hold the Door’ baby, it's cold outside and SUBS are planning on dropping those Back-to-Semester blues to record-low temperatures. Surrounded by the whitest snows and mahogany walls, we don’t need a fireplace to turn up the heat, because this affair is already L.I.T.

WINTER HAS COME.

So swap your trackies for your mumma’s luxury fur coat (faux of course, holla PETA), wrap yourselves in that beloved cashmere Burberry Scarf, and kick on those F.R.E.S.H. Yeezy 950 Duckboots for this Insta-worthy vacation. Come in your finest winter attire: dressing gowns, ski jackets, ear-muffs and reflective goggles should be packed. The faster you ski down one of Aspen’s BIG FOUR mountains, the faster you’ll be getting into the HOTTEST (yet, COLDEST) party of the year.

BUT don’t speed dial your therapist just yet! Because Daddy is out of town, and left the keys to his yacht in the glove box of the Porsche Macan parked downstairs…

So really, the only struggle you’re faced with is deciding which mode of transport to take to the wharf! I mean like Uber Lux is never available at peak hour and we just can’t get dust onto your Audi A3 now can we?

So swap your almond mylk chai latte (& half a sugar) for an Midori Spritz for the night, and your Lulu Lemon Activewear for Ralph Lauren cashmere and show Daddy what happens when his golden child is ignored…because SUBS’ beloved HMAS Inheritance is setting sail! 
 
Sydney University Business Society is proud to present: ‘Daddy’s Yacht Party; a Celebration of Parental Dependency’. 

Oh, and we suggest you best avoid the pizzas we’re serving on entry because your Skinnytea detox would go to waste. But then again, we know you’re used to open bars so open bar at SUBS cruise it is!!! Ladies, make sure your liner is waterproof and highlighter on fleekkkk. Gents, think Jay Gatsby class and effortless smoulders. It’s certainly going to be a night to remember... or not ;)

*************************************

Ladies and gentlemen of business schools and other faculties around NSW (yes, tonight we'll let it slide and accept you as one of us). As the dark cloud, better known as Semester 2 looms and begins to cast its shadow, we at SUBS feel that something must be done. 

So, in heroic business student fashion, we have decided to take ownership of this 
abhorrent responsibility. Let us take action and rise above this ominous fog that is Semester 2. Let us get ridiculously turned up. Let us rebel against the system and prove that we can and will party like the future CEOs.

What is expected:

- LOTS of camo and other military themed outfits. Dress up people. Now is not the time to be afraid. Embrace the camo. 

- 'Sun's out, gun's out' is a policy that we're going to have to enforce--sorry. It may be winter, and it will be night time, but all you bronzed beauties that have just arrived back from Europe and successfully teased us Sydneysiders with your 24-7 Insta updates, it's time to take one for the team. We don't care if it's 10C. Guns out people, guns out. 

- Shots shall be fired all night long. Just as Lionel Richie always intended.

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

Dress up as whatever you dreamed of becoming as a kid, get down and party your way into Summer 2016/17!

After you've completed just over 2 weeks of your baby steps into the University of Sydney we thought you'd appreciate the opportunity to get out of your comfort zone, broaden your horizon and generally ruin more cliches.

The SASS team wants to embrace students from the entire faculty whether you do Government, Gender Studies, Economics or Languages (and many more!). Even if you haven't decided what you want to specialise in, come along to Arts Camp to discover new people and new experiences! 

We'll be catching a bus down from the University quadrangle to our favourite campground on Friday afternoon and returning on Sunday afternoon. The days and nights will be filled with activities and a chance to socialise including our famous dance party on the last night with the theme of 'I can't believe you wore that!'. 

Alcohol will be provided*, although the event IS open to all ages (you youngun's under-18 won't be allowed to drink ofc). Camp Leaders from the 2017 Executive of SASS will be responsible for student's welfare and safety throughout the camp.

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

Dress up as whatever you dreamed of becoming as a kid, get down and party your way into Summer 2016/17!

We know you're looking for a chance to celebrate the end of a flat out, ball-busting semester full of soy chai latte sipping and philosophical dissertations. We know you're hoping for an unforgettable night that you honestly probably will have trouble remembering (cos you gotta clear out some space in the memory bank to make room for last minute finals cramming, right?). And we know you're looking to do it all in style on a sick cruise with an even sicker light show in the background. 

This year we're still giving you a chance to get a lil dressed up, but we wanna spice it up and get VIVID as well. So break out your cocktail dress and button-up + blazer, but don't be afraid to throw in some colour as well - the more VIVID the better! 

So join us on June 2 (Thursday of the last week of semester!) for what's sure to be a spectacularly SASSy time. There'll be banging tunes, good food, A STEADY SUPPLY OF FREE ALC, a sweet DF and all your favourite SASSy mates. Tickets have sold out FAST in the past, so get on it asap. You won't wanna miss this.

From the 21st to the 23rd of March, SASS Camp will be a time to replenish your youthful souls with the partying, befriending and watersliding we desperately crave.

Held at the Cataract Scout Park in Appin, SASS Camp will begin by meeting outside the Quadrangle on Friday afternoon - times will be confirmed soon. We will be going down and back up in coaches. However, if you would prefer to arrive in style of your own accord, please let us know. 

We will be staying in a mix of cabins and lodges for the two nights before returning to the University on Sunday afternoon. Arrangements for heading home from the University are your own decision.

We will have registration forms up in the next few days.

Please come down and support the cause! ALL donations goes towards the Nepal Earthquake Relief funds. 

If you cannot make it on the day, please feel free to donate to our Everyday Hero page on World Vision Australia, there is no minimum amount and all funds will be directly sent to World Vision Australia! 
https://nepalappeal2015.everydayhero.com/au/fabsoc-for-nepal


FABSOC (Fashion & Beauty Appreciation Society) is aiming to raise at least $1,000 and clothing donations, where 100% of donations raised will assist orphanages, organisations, hospitals and families in receiving the required treatment, equipment and funding needed to rebuild their lives and help Nepal. We will be donating 100% of funds to World Vision Australia where they will distribute funds accordingly. 

At FABSOC, we aim to use fashion as a segue for good causes and charitable work, as well as promote self-confidence and awareness through fashion. Through our fundraiser, we aim to promote our philanthropist nature and humanitarian values to help Nepal overcome this natural disaster, where a tumultuous earthquake of a magnitude of 7.9 struck Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal on the 25th April 2015. 

So far there have been over 6,000 deaths and an exponential amount of casualties and injuries. Nepal has a population of 27.8 Million people, where 50% of it's population are young children under the age of 18. Due to the increasing number of casualties, hundreds of thousands of children have been critically injured, separated from their families or are still trapped beneath the rubble and debris. Nepal as a nation has always suffered from impoverishment, governmental issues and a lack of infrastructure, due to this it's important to keep in mind that Nepal is desperately struggling during this time due to its LEDC status. 

Please keep Nepal in your hearts at this turbulent time, any donations, items of clean clothing or words of support is encouraged and welcomed.

Artistic Director: Bec Clare
Producer: Gaby Boulos
Cast: 83 brilliant talented dancers

Sydney Uni's Movement & Dance Society has produced some quality productions over its few years in existence, but this show promises to be the biggest and best yet! 

LOCUS explores the personal growth and the masks people make for themselves. This investigation into the inner and outer depicts the circumstances, lifestyles, occassions, themes and emotions that shape people's lives, and celebrates the contribution of those events to the formation of the individual.
 
So whether you're a dance-lover, a dance-appreciator or know nothing about dance at all, come to experience Locus and enjoy the way our stories can be expressed through dance.
We've got you covered from contemporary, jazz, ballet to tap, hip hop, cha cha, Bollywood, and even some sick beat poetry.

The theme is ‘The Final Countdown’. So, basically it’s the last night on Earth, civilisation is crumbling all around us and you have ONE last crazy night to live it up… WHAT and WHO will you be? You decide how you want to spend your final night and what style/impression you want to give off. That could be reliving the glory days of your 90s pop childhood, or digging out that dusty flapper tap costume you once danced in… Or it could just be coming in your birthday suit… ya know, you do you! But whatever it is, make it count! This theme can literally encompass everything and anything, so if you’re thinking right now “ooh I don’t know about that.. does it even fit?” “Will I look weird?” “people won’t get this”…. JUST DO ITTTTT. We dare you. 

So, this epic party is in a few weeks (the Friday of week 13) and it’s taking place at none other than the Red Rattler Theatre in Marrickville, which for those of you who don’t know is the sickest, and grooviest venue EVERRR.

I repeat, $12 Mojitos. And if that doesn’t add flavor to your life, I don’t know what will. 

So, details, on Tuesday the 27th, the actual salsa lesson starts at 8pm, but we shall meet there at 7pm so we can down as many drinks as possible beforehand to make up for the fact that our hips DO NOT in fact lie… Shakira was wrong. 

Further info here: http://merivale.com.au/whats-on/event/celebrate-all-things-salsa/

Also, added bonus, we will be meeting at 6pm beforehand for food/nibbles. Two options here: either we can get food at Establishment; they have a cute (and surprisingly not too expensive) snacks menu, that has like burgers, chips, dips and bread, etc OR we could go to Frankie’s Pizza (on Hunter Street, around the corner) for pizza and the best apple vodka’s eva. Frankie’s is a super chill and cool bar, and it suits our budget (LOL #studentlyfe #igotyourbacksguys). Let me know your preferences for either of those of you're planning on coming beforehand :) Establishment is more convenient but pizzzzaaaa?

386,madsocusyd,The Stroke of Midnight: The 2014 Performing Arts Ball,242,43,356,0,43,684,"Once upon a time, in a strange world not too dissimilar to the Camperdown campus of the University of Sydney, there gathered four forces of a most ordinary kind:

MADSOC, SUDS, SURCAS and MUSE are proud to present The Stroke of Midnight: The 2014 Performing Arts Ball.

Following in the successes of 2013, the premier evening for performing arts on campus is here again to celebrate those who persist in (magically) wasting their time on stages. It’s a splendid excuse to get into obnoxious costume and rub elbows with those others at Sydney who hone themselves as entertainers – the nearest thing to real magic we have.

Of all the venues alluded to in the moving fables of Aesop, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, the most enchanting and fantastic is undoubtedly the Holme refectory. Transported from the drudgery of central Sydney, the venue is being specially reopened for this occasion, converted to a Germanic wood and princely ball, liable for the losing of many an unwanted child, and the finding of gingerbread houses.

The evening includes drinks, canapés and entertainment from all four societies, as well as live music and an invariably successful after party (we have booked a secret venue that lies in the fantasy lands beyond the reaches of the drink controlling tyrants, Baird and O’Farrell).

Last year the event sold out, so book early. Tickets can be purchased online here: http://www.trybooking.com/ERBW, and will not be sold on the door.

_______________________________________________________

MAGNETIC is a dance performance event that looks at the capacity of our bodies to affect and be affected. The show aims to leave audiences considering the different ways that bodies can mean and to highlight the body as an event, as a happening. How is consciousness shaped by the push and pull of different forces. What draws us in? What repels us? What forces exert on us and forge us into the beings we are today?

MAGNETIC is an experiment. What happens when you bring together 12 young and talented choreographers of different styles, working only with the concept of 'MAGNETIC' to bind them? How do choreographers, dancers, audiences make links between disparate and conceptual representations of 'MAGNETIC'? The end result is a hybrid production of hip-hop, contemporary, bellydancing, ballet, Argentine tango, jazz, rumba, tap & JFH.

MAGNETIC is an outlet for creativity, inspiration, interpretation, potential. It is founded on the fact that no dance style or embodied expression is more tenable or deserving than another. That no grand narrative or storyline is more important than the one you imagine as you take in the show. But more than anything...

MAGNETIC is potential...

Potential to be whatever you want it to be...be affected.",Seymour Centre,Sydney,Australia,"Corner City Road and Cleveland Street, Chippendale",2008.0,-33.88822289,151.19355430000005,3441,20:00:00+1000,2013-09-20,0

‘Salsa from the Heart’ is organized as part of AUJS’ Peace Week 2013, which aims to promote charity and dialogue between students of all faiths and cultural backgrounds. And what better dialogue is there than the universal language of dance? (MADSOC wholeheartedly agrees.)

PERFORMING ARTS BALL 2013: THE BLITZ BALL

When the air-raid sirens wail most Londoners head for the shelters to wait out the night. But a select few, as fire rains from the sky, raise their glasses, unbowed and unbroken by the threat to their homeland. They fight the war with joy and laughter; eating, drinking, and dancing the night away, winning the battle for hearts and minds.

From London's high society to military personnel, domestic and international, the guests can be anyone. Dressed to the nines, and with the the refurbished nightclub-bunker fully stocked, Britain's finest musicians and performers are invited to entertain.

You are invited to the Blitz Ball.

Keep calm and party on.

With dance societies from UTS, UNSW, UWS and Macquarie in attendance (not to mention our bro' from another mo', Soulxpress), this is an event not to be missed!

LE'GO welcomes dancers of all styles and levels, with one of its main events this year being inspired by the Vegas Group Rounds in So You Think You Can Dance. We'll be throwing five dancers from different styles together, giving them a short piece of music (it could be Usher...or Tchaikovsky! GASP) and asking them to come up with a fun and entertaining dance piece. (Don't worry, it's not as intimidating as it sounds, and the main thing is to have fun and make friends!)

So what are you waiting for? We're looking for anywhere between 10-20 happy campers from MADSOC to join us on our LE'GO adventure. Keep an eye on this page for more information and updates!

The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde

“I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.”

Jack Worthing created the identity of his fictional brother Ernest in order to escape his own mundane life and woo the woman of his dreams. Now that he may finally have her, he has decided to confess his true identity and kill off his ‘brother’ for good. It’s the perfect plan. That is, until fellow bachelor Algernon decides to show up at his country estate, also claiming to be Mr Ernest Worthing.

Originally performed in 1895, Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People” is widely considered to be the ultimate comedy of manners, examining the triviality of social conventions and obligations against the backdrop of polite society.

A brilliant surgeon is working over his operating table. But this time, all is not quite right. A mistake is made, a life is lost, and the surgeon can suddenly no longer bear to touch the living. 

Set in contemporary Sydney, Suzie Miller’s Caress/Ache is a collection of five stories exploring human connection through touch; a surgeon unable to stand physical contact with the living, a couple tearing each other apart as they try to survive infidelity, a flunked out uni student yearning for her place in the world, a mother fighting to embrace her son one last time.

By Nick Harriott and Tom Waddell

Divorce hits families hard - and no-one gets hit harder than the dads. When Nick (Nick Harriott) is kicked out of his own home after twenty years of marriage, he has nowhere to turn but the lean arms of long time divorcée Tom Waddell (Tom Waddell). Throughout the days and nights crashing in Tom’s man cave, all Nick wants is to get his wife back - but Tom longs for the good old days and will stop at nothing to keep the boys together.

Divorced Dads is an original one act play dedicated to Nick and Tom’s own divorced dads, Chris and Mike.

Show Dates: 7–17 March 2018

Available Roles: Lilly Cahill (Female)

Following one of our wonderfully talented cast members being accepted into NIDA’s acting program next year, we are looking to re-cast the roll of Lilly!
Punk Rock delves into the lives of seven students, heading towards their final exams in a private school in Stockport. A piece which could easily be mistaken for an off-beat romcom in its earlier scenes, quickly transforms as we are drawn into the students’ lives. Intimate moments reveal their concerns, their tenderness, their vulnerabilities. 
But the group interactions become sharper and more tense with every scene, as the students bully each other, lash out at one another, stand by and watch, and ultimately, push back. As the pressure builds and the group disintegrates, one character snaps with devastating consequence. If you swore you never wanted to relive Year 12, you’re going to want to make an exception for this one.

First round auditions will be held on 27 and 28 December, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 30-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Friday 29 December, and consist of between one and two-and-a-half hours of duologue work with other members of the ensemble.

To prepare for your audition:
1. Prepare the “Lilly” monologue. We want to be able to have a huge play with your monologue in the brief audition time we have, so memorisation is strongly encouraged!

You can find the monologue here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vypwRXmhboNkZxSHhlcXFjQms/view?usp=sharing

2. Read the script. It’s the point of reference for our work in the audition and callback, and taking the time to read the whole text before auditioning will be invaluable.

Show Dates: 14–17 February 2018
Roles: 2 male, 2 to 6 female

Caress/Ache throws us into the lives of ten very different people, all affected and linked by touch. But not just the skin on skin contact we immediately think of. They are touched by ideals. A poem. A political cause. The stories in this play are an attempt to follow the many threads of what it means to be ‘touched’. We get to deftly leap from a loud, heartbroken couple fighting and interrogating a case of infidelity, to a hilarious first day of working at a phone sex line. There is light and dark, joy and grief. The struggle for our characters to connect in this world of touch builds to a yearning crescendo and breaks through in a final embrace. Thank goodness for catharsis, am I right? 

First round auditions will run from November 12th – 24th, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 20-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Sunday 3rd of December.

What can you do to prepare for your audition?

1. Prepare one monologue from those attached. To get the most out of your audition, memorisation is highly encouraged. That way you can show us your brilliant acting chops without being encumbered by a piece of paper!

Monologues to choose from can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zxz1FLl4PaNaMl-CPHgZJTPsOCOodWVC 

2. Read the script. While Wikipedia does have a pretty good blurb, reading the script will give you a more detailed idea of what you’ll be in for. It will also give you an accurate and all-encompassing depiction of the characters in the play, and can help you work out which one you would be most interested to play. On top of that, we’d love to chat and hear some of the ideas you have about the script as a whole during your audition.

Two dishonest bachelors both assume the identity of the very fictional Ernest Worthing in order to escape their own lives but are forced to meet the consequences of their actions when they are ultimately discovered.

Originally performed in 1895 Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People” is widely considered as the ultimate comedy of manners, examining the triviality of social conventions and obligations against the backdrop of polite society.

SUDS Presents: Amédée or How to Get Rid of It
August 2nd-12th, 7.00pm
THE COMMON ROOM, HOLME BUILDING  

A comedy by Eugene Ionesco

“I can’t understand how we ever got into such a mess. It’s so unfair… And in a case like this… no-one to turn to for help and advice!...”

Amédée and Madeleine Buccinioni are a married couple who live in an apartment in Paris. They have not left this apartment for 15 years. Additionally… there is something unsettling in the next room. And its growing. 

Eugene Ionesco’s first full length, absurdist play deals with a decaying relationship haunted by past misdeeds and mistakes. Amédée, a playwright who has written only two lines of his play in 15 years and Madeleine, his disappointed and hardworking wife who is left to manage their increasingly dire situation. 

With an apartment that’s beginning to sprout mushrooms, ‘terrifying’ visits from the postman and something mysterious lurking in the next room, Amédée and Madeleine have created a world in their apartment which is strange and comical, yet at the same time immensely sad. Treated with characteristic wit, this tragic comedy goes deeper than just absurdity yet manages to touch the very heart of human relationships as we observe the severity of our actions and the danger of letting life pass you by…

“It beckoned to me, and I couldn't help but follow”

A series of disappeared persons line 100 years of Herald obituary sections. Despite the best efforts of the authorities, each search has proved fruitless.

As history begins to forget these lost souls, three social pariahs have come forward with a crazy theory they say links them all. So close to finding the answers and forever changing history, one of the group has mysteriously vanished; seemingly into thin air.

From the team behind the sold out immersive productions, ‘Weathervane’ and ‘a menagerie’, comes ‘In Two Circles’. Enter their world, be bold, and find your truth.

Hazelwood Jr. High
By Rob Urbinati

It’s 1989. Blue eyeshadow is in and hippies are out. Tiffany is so hot right now. Like something out of a John Hughes movie, six teenage girls traverse the halls of their high school.

See, there’s a new girl in town, Shanda. Amanda is totally in love with her. Melinda is pretty, popular and batshit crazy. Laurie Tuckett – she dropped out – is a psychopath. Hope is boy crazy and Toni can’t even get a date to homecoming.  

It’s just another day at Hazelwood Jr. High. But, as relationships bloom and people get dumped, a revenge plot is hatched. Things begin to spiral out of control. Open laughter moves from uncomfortable giggling to deep, dark silence.

It’s totally whacked out.

By Brad Fraser

Love and life are messy things — we get all tangled up as we look for connection and meaning in our existence. Things are complicated enough as it is, but add a serial killer into the mix and who knows what could happen…

Set in Edmonton, Alberta, the comedy-drama follows the lives of several sexually frustrated ‘thirty-somethings.’ Candy, who’s looking for the perfect man and true love; her homosexual roommate, David, who no longer believes love exists; Kane, a sexually confused teenager; Bernie, David’s troubled best friend; and Jerri, falling hopelessly in love with Candy. The otherworldly Benita, who overlooks the proceedings with a certain psychic knowledge. All of them try to learn the meaning of love — and all while a serial killer is terrorising the city, killing unidentified women…

Come viddy a real horrowshow that’ll knock you off yarblookos!

Translation: SUDS will be performing Anthony Burgess’s stage production of the novel (and Kubrick film) that was banned, glorified and idolised around the world: A Clockwork Orange. Tracking the story of 15 year old narrator, Alexander de Large, whose interests in sex, violence and Beethoven inevitably land him in prison, the administration of the controversial Ludovico technique begs the play’s overarching question: should humankind choose to be evil, or forced to be good?

Filled with delightful dark comedy and rife with references for true cinephiles and readers, come one, come all and view the cult classic adapted by SUDS.

Join us for a scintillating afternoon of performance on the sweeping lawns of the Quadrangle. Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” will be performed as never before. And, with any luck, as it will never be performed again! 

Follow the unfortunate journey of a motley cast and crew as they take on all the highs, lows and (often inevitable) disasters of student theatre. Watch them as things slide from bad to worse, forced to move from space to space, losing cast members and constantly running into less than cooperative characters along the way. But, as the age-old saying goes, the show must go on! Which in this case, means it must go on to the next performance space as soon as possible! 

SUDS’ “Walking with Woolf” will take you on an exciting (and manageable) journey around campus and will also feature performances from MUSE, SUSO and SURCAS. So come walk with us for a crash course in student theatre.

From Gillian: ""You want an abstract recipe for some vids involving me and some sexy interplay with food? All whilst I attempt to develop an interplay between identity, culture and consumerism within contemporary society? Yeh thought so... Its grotty, weird and feels like the furry sensation you get when you haven't brushed your teeth for a while. My mum doesn't like my films but yours does, what more can I say.""

There’s no way to describe this film without spoiling. It’s a short documentary, about 100 minutes, about parental relationships. There is a significant chance that this will be the festival favourite, and it’s an important palette cleanser after the film about robot cops.

Movie? STORIES WE TELL (2012) dir. Sarrah Polley.

You said the films were too old, let’s get topical!

We’ll be serving, depending on the weather, HOT CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE (BYO IRISH); or ICY COLD RED BULLS.

RUN SHEET:

1AM: THE DEAD ZONE, dir. David Cronenberg. The film that launched the career of Christopher Walken, THE DEAD ZONE concerns a man suddenly able to see people’s futures by touching them. Incidental contact with a charismatic political candidate reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

3AM: THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP AS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, dir. 62,979,879 American People and, according to some, Breitbart, 4chan, and Senator Bernie Sanders. The ceremony that launches a new era in America concerns a country suddenly able to see their future by voting incorrectly. THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

tl;dr:

What time is this? The Inauguration starts around 3am, but to be safe we’ll be aiming for coverage from 2:30am. There will be a fun film shown immediately before.

Sunday, 15th January, 7pm for a 7:15pm start.

This week: Paul Verhoeven’s 1987 film, ROBOCOP.

The city of Detroit is in financial ruin and is about to be privatised by Omni Consumer Products. The underfunded Detroit Police Department threatens to strike. A corrupt board of corporate fat cats argues over who has the best disruptive app replacement for cops.

Despite how it sounds (a film about a Robot Cop), the film introduced American audiences to Verhoeven’s dark, sometimes-absurd style of satire. It’s filled with fake ads, Reaganomics, and the bad guy is played by the Dad from That 70s Show.

Movie? Robocop (1987) dir. Paul Verhoeven.
Didn’t that come out last year? No please it is NOT the remake it is VERY different.
Why would an international corporation want to buy Detroit of all places? Because you can save money not giving your citizens water.
Groan. What’s wrong I thought I sold this well?
I thought Courtney was picking the movie this time? I have barricaded myself in the Cellar to prevent this from happening but she is picking the next one.

It’s the height of Summer and there’s no better way to spend a humid Sunday evening than with your friends at the pictures.

First up: Spike Lee’s 1989 opus “Do The Right Thing”. The film depicts rising tensions in a Brooklyn suburb during a heatwave and was criticised at release for “inciting black audiences to riot”. 

Really what it did was clarify Spike Lee’s developing artistic vision. It’s a kinetic film, interspersed with slice-of-life vignettes that create a vibrant sense of neighbourhood previously absent from Hollywood’s grim, gawky portrayals of the ghetto. 

It’s equal parts funny and tragic and is, above all else, entertaining.

We’ll be serving popcorn and choctops on a pay what you want platform, there will be no ticket price at the door. We would advise all viewers to bring snacks and drinks themselves. This isn’t Dendy, we won’t be searching your bags. Free popcorn for anyone who brings a pillow to sit on, but there will also be enough chairs/pillows/comfy jackets from the costume room for all. 

We’re constructing a projector screen. We’ve keyed the cellar’s speakers to surround sound. We’ve torrented a bluray.* This is Alana Cherry’s projector as you have never seen before.

While they brag about their refurbished apartment, Vanek tries to be enthused. They gradually begin a verbal attack on Ferdinand, but, when he turns to leave, they beg him to stay, as they unveil that their latest project is him.

DOZENS OF COUSINS is twenty years in the future, placing Vanek back in the living room of Michael and Vera, shadowed by their maid Beda, for the same old games in a shiny new context: communism has died with a whimper and the Free World beckons with drugs, luxuries, and untold exotic wonders.

This double bill presents two of the infamous autobiographical Vanek Plays written by Vaclav Havel, recounting actual events from his life as a browbeaten artist, who would later bring about the fall of corrupt communism and establish the modern democracy that is the Czech Republic. They’re fast paced, funny, witty political farces.

How do we as creative people thrive and exist in a society which seems intent on telling us that what we have to contribute to society is useless bordering on irrelevant?

Do we kill ourselves?

Medicate legally or illegally?

Do we treat everything with a sheen of ironic pleasure, lulling ourselves in to a faint sense of blissful ignorance?

How do we navigate the murky waters of genuine heartfelt discovery that is constantly being probed and dismantled?

Maybe we should sit in the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY’S dankest hole nude peeling potatoes for 24ish hours where predominantly students of the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY can gawk at us, staring at our genitals and giggling at the hilarity of it all, trying to think up meaning.

It has been said that Tabitha’s great-great-great-great-great-grandfather started a war, which would forever change China’s place in the world. But when she looks in the mirror, she can see herself belonging to both sides. 

Part history, part confession, A Westerner’s Guide to the Opium Wars wonders whether it’s worth holding onto the branches of the family tree.

Cellar Theatre, Sydney University

""The actual facts are so simple. I love you. You love me. You love Otto. I love Otto. Otto loves you. Otto loves me. There now! Start to unravel from there.""

‘Design For Living’ is Noel Coward’s 1931 comedy about a ménage-a-trois. Otto, Leo and Gilda love each other but can’t quite make their love work. From their bohemian life in Paris to the heights of their success in New York, we see these three characters try and navigate the difficult world of “love among the artists.”

This production aims to reveal the melancholic heart at the centre of Coward’s most controversial comedy.

THE BOOK OF JOB
7pm, 21-24 September
Cellar Theatre, University of Sydney

The Book of Job is one of the most fraught texts of our culture. It is a book from the old testament. It is a book about why we all suffer. It's about why you think “oh, jeez, I thought stuff was meant to be good but now it's bad, damn.” 

Also portions of it dont make sense. Despite this, truly astonishing poetry remains, rendering the text painfully compelling. We turned it into a play. It features God. God is a big man in the sky. He is a big dude and he is extremely scary. He has a big beard and is very very strong. I like God but I'm not sure he likes me :(

The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare
7pm, 31 August and 1-2 September
5:30pm, 3rd September 
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

“Hath not a Jew eyes?” 

In Venice, Antonio borrows 3000 ducats from Shylock, risking a pound of flesh if he forfeits.

In Belmont, a wealthy heiress Portia can neither choose or refuse love, but must marry whoever solves her dead father’s puzzle. 

But plans to elope, ill luck at sea, and a culture of prejudice forces these disparate narratives together, drawing Portia and Shylock into a terminal conflict that threatens the peace and order in Venice.

This streamlined production of ""The Merchant of Venice"" will interrogate the assumptions that precede one of William Shakespeare’s most compelling and controversial plays.

Summer and Smoke, by Tennessee Williams
7pm, 10 – 13 and 17 – 20 August
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

""What you have here is not the anatomy of a beast, but a man.""

A Minister’s daughter’s beliefs are thrown into question when a romance blooms with a young off-the-rails doctor. As she strives for something beyond the tangible, something greater than taste or touch or sight, her life and the lives of those she loves are thrown into chaos.

Appropriated to urban Sydney circa 2016 and heavily scored with a mix of classical and electro-dubstep music, Summer & Smoke reinvents a masterpiece by one of the great American playwrights to question the value of conservatism to a modern audience.

“…Marvellously young and marvellously beautiful. Youth and beauty are the only things worth having in this world…”

Inspired by the words of a new acquaintance, the young Dorian Gray gazes upon his freshly-painted portrait and wishes that the image might grow old while he might remain young. To the detriment of all around him, his wish is granted. 

A new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ by Nadia Bracegirdle, 'Dorian' explores obsession, love, vice, and what it means to place aesthetic ideals above all else.  In this decadent and carefree world is an underbelly of shame, fear, blackmail, and violence, which begs the question: how far are we willing to go to maintain our ideals?

Written by Phillip Ridley 

This play calls itself “the story of you and your first great love”

Tender Napalm is a 2 hander involving a man and a woman exploring their relationship and their battles of love, compassion and grief.  Riding through waves of storytelling, fantasy and past memories they create armies against each other while deflecting the distance and pain growing in between them.  It studies the violence of love and association with hate and the bond created through grief.

Beat: (noun) the basic unit of time in music, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level.

Beat is a show served in two parts, these parts playing consecutively over two weeks.

Part 1 explores silence as an essential element of drama and a by-product of human communication - does silence speak louder than words? How do humans communicate and miscommunicate? Does silence carry across culture?

What is language but a construct? What is communication but a facilitator of relationships?

JE NE SAIS QUOI is an original bilingual play by Alana Cherry and Victoria Zerbst that traverses planes of time and space to crystallise answers to these questions. Art and philosophy intersect, lovers collide, words are exchanged, misshapen, and lost in this intellectual romp across language and culture. 

At its crux, it is a glimpse into the heart of human connections through the lives of six – a French couple, an Australian couple, and a pair of writers. But throw in a sarcastic waiter, a live band, a cabaret number, and a mime, and suddenly every character questions the nature of conversation and human interaction. Can their connections transcend our constructed barriers of communication? Qu’est-ce que c’est, l’amour?

Over the course of a single day, six characters’ lives are meshed and moulded, as they flirt with notions of romance, music, and Capital A Art.

In a quiet country town, long ago, there lived a girl who wasn’t happy. Lady is stuck, labelled, bored. Washing clothes and leering men, marriage, children, routine – a life her mother accepts, her friend awaits. A life she must escape. 

Bathed in blood our heroine drowns, drifts and surfaces, desperate to emerge, rise from the depths of her nothing life and stand on her own feet. She won’t take less than greatness. With magic and lies she’ll get what she wants. If the sacrifices she makes on the way throw nature out of joint Lady only cares that it’s known the chaos was her doing. 

Witness the rise of a great woman who did much more than stand behind a great man.

Girl doesn’t really want to put a label on anything, but figures this might be the chance to finally have something worth putting a label on. 

But there’s something wrong with this romantic comedy, and it isn't just the hacky writing and the two dimensional female lead and the fact that these tropes are force-fed and familiar.  

Between ex-girlfriends and loud sisters and sharks with machine guns, Joe and Sierra manage to find something they can call their own romance. After all, Sierra really is Joe’s dream girl. It’s almost as if she was made for him. 

Manic Pixie Dream World is a new play exploring the stereotypes and tropes of the romantic comedy and the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

""O hell, to choose love by another's eyes!”

Helios. Demetrius. Hermia. Lysander.

Four lovers flee into the forest, away from their parents and a society that says they can't be together. As bonds are broken, family and friendship are shown to be as flawed as the standards they are built on. Family can be escaped, can values?

“This same progeny of evils comes from our dissension.”

Puck. Titania. Oberon. Theseus. Hippolyta. Egeus.

In a constant fight for dominance, games are played with the mortals and forest as pawns. Power can be won, but is it worth it when you tear apart those beneath you?

“Never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it.”

Bottom. Quince. Flute. Snout. Snug. Starveling.

A patch of rude mechanicals come together to rehearse a play, but the deeper they delve into the forest, the harder this proves. Can you remain true in world that has forgotten how to understand you? 

As these narratives interweave, the ability for us to engage; with ourself, with others, and with the values of others, is called into question. Why do we struggle to understand the world beyond ourself? Is this why we’re homophobic or selfish? Do we allow ourselves to treat it as a dream?

The magic of theatre in Shakespeare’s Midsummer captivates the imagination of its audiences; infinitely complex yet poetically simple, the play seeks out a world attainably beautiful. A Midsummer Night's Dream will leave its audiences from all walks of life with the elusive question of how we understand theatre, and how we understand each other— If you engage that is, it could just be a dream.

The event is structured with two panel discussions - a Junior Panel and a Senior Panel. The Junior Panel will address questions related to the summer internship opportunities provided by the firms, their recruitment processes and what a typical workday for a Graduate would look like. The Senior Panel will address questions regarding the industry and the panellists’ experiences within their own careers. Another key feature of this event will be the two Guest Speakers who will be sharing their own insights and extensive knowledge of the industry. 

Following the panel discussion, there will be an open networking session where students will have the opportunity to engage closely with sponsor representatives and ask more specific questions tailored to their interests.

The SUEUA executive is proud to present our biggest and favourite event of the year: Engineering Ball! Faculty balls are your chance to dress up and let loose with all your friends, be a little fancy, and ignore all the consequences.

This year Engineering will be returning to the Ivy Ballroom, for a 3 course meal, unlimited drinks and live music. The theme for this year is Bond! Diamonds are Forever, so bring your best suit/gown, and prepare your liver to Die Another Day.

Price of your ticket obviously includes entry into the rest of The Ivy to party into the morning, because Tomorrow Never Dies.

Historically, our ball has been both better AND cheaper than all the other faculties', and this year is no exception. This year, in the finest venue we've ever had the pleasure of occupying, we bring to you our most generous drinks package ever, an incredible menu (updates to come), and the live jazz quartet to serenade you through the night. The pricing is:

Member: $85
Access: $95
Non-access: $120

Tickets will be sold this Friday at midday. Engineering Ball has a tendency to sell out on the first day, with lines known to stretch around PNR. Make sure to get in early to ensure you get a ticket!

Please note that this event is 18+, and your ID will be required to get into the Ivy.

This year's ball is being sponsored by our friends and colleagues at Susquehanna International Group (SIG), and we're excited to hear briefly from one of their representatives during our event. You can check out opportunities with SIG here: https://sig.com/

It'll cost you $5 to get in on gameplay. That should cover all of us for every game.
We'll start with tables of 10. When you get slapped, instead of stacking cups, you'll hold on to the empty one you just drank. Once the game ends, the five people with the fewest cups will progress to the next round.
***If you get stuck in the cage, and get slapped 3 times in a row, you are knocked out***

Engineering has a proud history as the oldest (so I'm told) continuously running (deregistration doesn't matter so long as the show goes on) faculty revue at USYD. In recent history, this has been largely due to the inspiring leadership of our 2016 director, Mattie Longfield!

Each year, the best acts and sketches are selected from the faculty and identity revues, provided with a solid injection of cash, and combined together to make one super revue! Engo revue made the cut with one of our sketches this year, and Mattie has been attending rehearsal every Thursday (yes, instead of partying) to do us proud. 

To support our friend, and as an excellent excuse to enjoy a drop or two on a thursday night, we'll be attending the revue, preceded by some cheeeeap drinks outside PNR. Pick up tickets here: https://www.seymourcentre.com/events/event/2017-sydney-uni-revue/ Obviously, SUEUA does not recommend taking more drinks into the Seymour Centre for during the show, or heckling the performers - these behaviours would certainly be frowned upon.

The SUEUA executive is proud to present our biggest and favourite event of the year: Engineering Ball! Faculty balls are your chance to dress up and let loose with all your friends, be a little fancy, and ignore all the consequences: because it's right before midsem!

This year Engineering will be returning to the Ivy Ballroom, for a 3 course meal, unlimited drinks and live music. The theme for this year is Roaring 20s! Get dressed up and ready to stay a little more classy than we might be used to. Protest the prohibition, and learn how to dance without grinding (only for the first part of the night, don't worry), all while eating and drinking in absolute style and the greatest company. Price of your ticket obviously includes entry into the rest of The Ivy to party into the morning after the Ball is over.

Historically, our ball has been both better AND cheaper than all the other faculties', and this year is no exception. This year, in the finest venue we've ever had the pleasure of occupying, we bring to you our most generous drinks package ever, an incredible menu (updates to come), and the JazzSoc 18-piece big band to soothe us through dinner and swing us into the afterparty. The pricing is:
Member: $85
Access: $95
Non-access: $105

Tickets will be sold this Friday at midday. Engineering Ball has a tendency to sell out on the first day, with lines known to stretch around PNR. Make sure to get in early to ensure you get a ticket!

Please note that this event is 18+, and your ID will be required to get into the Ivy.

This year's ball is being sponsored by our friends and colleagues at Accenture, and we're excited to hear briefly from one of their representatives during our event. You can check out opportunities with accenture here: https://www.accenture.com/au-en/careers/graduate-home

A hundred years have passed and the Fire Team is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my demonstator and the men of my lab journeyed to the Earth Tradies to help fight against the Fire Team, leaving me and my partner to look after the Lab.

SUMO, MUGS and SparkSoc are proud to present this year; the inaugural Engineering Industry Dinner. Bringing together the largest collection of industry representatives for engineers of all disciplines; the 7th April will herald your biggest chance this year to network with the bastions of the industry.

With companies such as Microsoft, Google, Schneider, Ausgrid and over 40 more; the Holme Refectory will be the site of a network opportunity impossible to miss. The range of companies covers mostly areas in Electrical, Software, Automation, Mechanical and Consultancy; but due to the vast expanse of disciplines that all these companies cover, all degrees can find companies suited to themselves here.

Tonight will be a night of networking. So it’s highly suggested that in between the unlimited canapes and drinks that you take this valuable time to engage with all the industry guests present. Find out how their companies deal with graduates, what work would you be apart of, do they offer internships? Think of questions before the night and seek out those that can help you answer them. Make sure you research companies beforehand, it’ll be no good asking your Mechanical Engineering questions to Google.

Tickets will be sold from Week 1 onwards by SUMO, MUGS and SparkSoc outside of PNR, watch this event for information on the time we are present. There are limited spots and it’d be a waste of such a golden opportunity to miss a ticket because you thought you could just buy one at the last minute.

The emphasis is on natural development i.e. learning by PLAYING football. No coaching but organising FUN football exercises is the key to helping players build a love for the game. Another highlight of the course is that the coaches are exposed to basic rules of the game as well as tips and hints on building a football culture in a completely practical setting.
This qualification will look great on your portfolio, but it also demonstrates that you have a commitment to advance yourself and your knowledge as a professional.

In case you missed it, last year’s Purple Sneakers Tenth Birthday celebration was one of the events of Vivid Sydney 2016. Those who were there will remember a line stretching around the block all night, hundreds of punters, nearly 30 acts over three stages, and more good vibes than we could have ever hoped for! 
 
The event featured the two things that matter most to Purple Sneakers: new emerging club music, and the Sydney music community. And as such the lineup we presented included some of our favourite emerging artists (incl. Moonbase, MEZKO, World Champion, Lastlings & more), as well as some of our favourite Sydney music community friends like Astral People, Linda Marigliano, Pilerats, Motorik, Stoney Roads, Andy Garvey, Sidechains, UNDR Ctrl, Luen Jacobs and many more. 
 
So, it made sense to do it all again this year as we blow out an extra candle on the birthday cake on Saturday 17th of June!  
 
For this year’s event, we’ve continued to carefully curate a lineup of exciting up-and-comers that we have supported on the blog and have loved to see grow over the past 12 months. The live stage will feature the internet hip hop poetry of Kimchi Princi; the forward-thinking production of Ninajirachi, the upbeat pop of Gussy; the serene sounds of OKBadlands, the futuristic sounds of Sortagoth, and the captivating electronica of Willaris. K. 
It wouldn’t be a Purple Sneakers party without a few community friends in the mix though, would it? Joining our live room will be two other stages just like last year - this year playing host to collectives and Sydney legends like Bad Deep, Fling Fling, Heaps Gay DJs, Kali Picnic, LOW TON, Matka, Mowgli May, Sandro Dallarmi, Sidehustle, SURG, Trench Records, Volumes, and of course Purple Sneakers DJs, as well as a very special DJ set from Christopher Port. 
 
Held at our spiritual home of The Lord Gladstone in Chippendale from 5pm to 3am, this year’s event will again be free entry, so we recommend you come down early as entry will be first in, first served.  
 
Purple Sneakers Eleventh Birthday is presented by world renowned cultural institution Vivid Sydney, Young Henry’s, and Sydney’s FBi Radio, who recently invited Purple Sneakers to broadcast on the main station, after presenting a show for 3 years on electronic music focused sister digital station FBi Click. 
 
So join Purple Sneakers as we celebrate another birthday as a tribute to all that we’ve done over the past year as a music community, a blog, a radio show, and so much more. 
 
Full lineup and details below. See you there!

THIS IS NEXT WEDNESDAY THE 12TH.

Our two presenters are Chris Taylor (of Chaser fame) and Michael Bradley (Managing Partner of Marque Lawyers).

Chris Taylor needs no introduction, but it's worth recalling the fact that as a Triple J presenter he promised to do a nudie run at Big Day Out if the Media Watch theme song was voted into the Hottest 100 (it did, and he did).

Michael Bradley's most recent high-profile case was the Dallas Buyers Club decision that made national headlines earlier this year. He has also represented Sony and Penelope Cruz. Bradley is almost as famous for his office eccentricities, which include having law students apply for clerkships by making a diorama, and giving all his staff $400 to spend on a pair of shoes.

We will be covering:
- Tech: how to use the MECO studio
- Content: how to make good radio
- Legal: defamation and media law in a community radio context

It is ESSENTIAL that you or your co-host attends training if you intend to have a show this semester. This goes for people who had a show last semester. Pizza and drinks at Courtyard are included in the price!

You can register for the tournament here:  https://goo.gl/forms/qyFbjdZ5WIuA75Fz1

Registration fee is $15 to help cover field hire etc. You will be emailed payment details with confirmation of your registration.

This is a tournament for USyd players but we're trying to be fairly inclusive still. Therefore, to be eligibile to play, you must fill one of the following criteria: 
(1) Are a current member or have been a member of Sydney University Quidditch Society 
(2) Have been on the roster of / have played for a USyd Team
(3) Have been/are in one of the USyd Teams groups (""201X USU Quidditch Team(s)"")

Our field booking is from 10am to 6pm, we intend to play some kind of round robin/double round robin format with finals, depending on the number of teams. Parking is available at the field, which is nearish Lindfield station, on the North Shore line. 

Pairs of Old and Current player co-captains will be chosen to choose teams in a draft (exact format yet to be determined but some kind of blind auction probably - some restrictions may be placed to promote roughtly even numbers of new/old players on teams, and roughly even numbers between teams). If you are interested in captaining (plz), you should indicate so on the form. 

We will also play an OldSyd vs NewSyd game at some point in the day, for banter. This will possibly involve a split of 2012-14 players vs 2015-17 players, or more probably a 50/50 split of players based on when they started playing, so that the NewSyd team doesn't blow out in numbers. May also be OldSyd vs CurrentSyd, depending on how the numbers work out/what will make for a more interesting game. 

We'll also be doing a BBQ lunch on the day (vego/vegan/healthy options available too). 

It should be a great chill day to catch up, have some fun, celebrate the long weekend, and play some quidditch - get hyped :D

Based on an earlier poll, the schedule will be as follows:

6:00 pm: Refreshments
6:30-6:40: Talks from sponsors Pulse by BOQ Specialist and Medical Indemnity Protection Society - MIPS
6.40 - 7.00: Overview of the two years, what each term is, core blocks vs specialty blocks 
7.00 - 7.15: Introduction to the exams - barriers, core blocks, long cases, PWH osces and approach to studying

7.35 - 7.50: Slav Nikolic on med school, having children and working
7.50 - 8.05: Erica Danieletto on mixing med school, work and life balance
8.05 - 8.20: What is a long case? How do they work? How do you practice? The manilla folder method
8:20 - 8:30 pm - Talks from NAMSA's Steven Campbell, specifically for international students

Our speakers will be:

KIERAN MUIR - STREAM 2/3 - ORANGE/SAN
Kieran hails from New Zealand originally but has gone under the cover for many years except when certain words sneak through. Spent the first two years at College, helped out on MedCamp in 2nd year and went out West for 3rd year to Orange. Spent his elective in South Africa, Nepal and New Zealand. Was involved with Convention during 4th Year and thinks he knows how to master the attendance and sign-off system quite well now. Kieran will be giving an overview to Stage 3 and discussing long case technique and the infamous manilla folder technique. 

EMMA SHEAVES - STREAM 3 - NORTHERN
Emma was previously a physiotherapist and has an avid interest in rural health, primary care (general practice and emergency medicine). Constantly at the top of the year for assessments and balances that with work and a number of other interests. Her stage 3 Core Terms were neurology/endocrinology (med 3), general surgery/orthopaedics (Lismore), critical care (RNSH), general practice /cardiology (med 4). She’ll be coming along to discuss stage 3 assessments, tips on study methods, exam information, and a general overview of stream 3. 

EMMA CUMMING - STREAM 4 - NEPEAN
Emma went to Lismore for year 3 and so is now an expert in shark attacks, Nimbin alterative medicine and whale watching. Emma will be discussing a typical week and ‘Day in the life of a Stage 3’ and her strategies on how to maintain the all important work/life balance. She’ll also be touching on where to live, study tips, organising a useful study group, endless podcasts, electives, MD project and many, many more topcis. 

SLAV NIKOLIC - STREAM 3 - WESTMEAD
Before med school Slav studied Exercise and Sports Science and then Physiotherapy, both at Sydney Uni (Cumberland Campus). Clearly a sucker for punishment, he followed the two degrees with Medicine. He has worked as a Physio at Westmead Hospital for 6 years and during med school has continued to work part time as a Physio on weekends. Slav is married and has two adorable children. Luka aged 4 years and Rafael aged 5 months (barrier exams with a 5-month-old…). Slav will be discussing a work/life/kid balance during Med School as well as some sage tips for the year. 

ERICA DANIELETTO - STREAM 3 - CONCORD
Erica hails from the least involved clinical school (Concord) and her med philosophy of flying under the radar means she also answers to Erin and Emma, so that will make remembering names on transition night even easier! Coming from a non-science background she can't tell you much about med, so instead she'll be talking about how awesome stream 3 is, being a secretarial mastermind, and bringing home the bacon. Her talk will cover how to be super organised with forms and other modules (eg. PPD, PopMed, Indigenous health, ophthal logbook) and working part-time during stage 3.

Thank you to our speakers for taking the time out to talk to us, and please come armed with all the questions you ever wanted to ask about Stage 3!

As part of the results, 15% of students reported currently suffering from a mental illness diagnosed by a psychiatrist and 19% have been diagnosed in the past. 

51% of students also reported having seen a professional for mental health issues in the past. 

What does this mean? Having a mental health issue doesn’t mean you’re more vulnerable or alone, and possessing resilience is only a small part of the solution in a difficult and competitive culture and working environment.

We know there’s much more to change and raising awareness is only the beginning, but we’re proud to present SUMS’ first ever Blue Party, an initiative started by AMSA Mental Health. All four years and external guests are invited, with activities, free food on the night, and most importantly, all profits going towards BeyondBlue.

That is why SUMS is proud to announce we will again be hosting a World’s Greatest Shave event at the Grandstand this year. The money raised for the Leukaemia Foundation will provide direct support to people living with blood cancers or help fund vital research as we get closer to becoming fully fledged doctors! 

In the lead up to the day, make sure to show your support and donate, and on the night, watch as your fellow medical students shave, colour or wax their hair for a great cause. You can also participate in our raffle on the night for a chance to win some great prizes as well. Or better yet, get involved and simply sign up at tinyurl.com/SUMSshaves to start your own journey!

More information about our speaker and the history of the Oration can be found at http://sydneymedsoc.wixsite.com/lambie-dew. This is a free event, but attendees will be required to register their attendance at https://goo.gl/forms/6i9EYNpQUs48MUkb2 for catering purposes.

The night will kick off with a Girl’s touch footy match at 6pm, followed by the Rugby at 6.50.

With USyd taking home the gravy 2 years ago, and last year cancelled due to extenuating circumstances (no one could be bothered), this year is shaping up to be bigger and better than any spectacle before it. 

Free food carts (courtesy of BOQ Specialist), Red Bull and Djs have all been confirmed for the event.

1049,Filmsoc.USyd,Halloween Double Feature: Ganja & Hess and Re-Animator,16,6,30,0,6,58,"For our final screening of the year, we’re showing a special Halloween themed double feature to wrap up 2017.

Screening first will be Bill Gunn’s 1973 film ‘Ganja & Hess’, an experimental horror take on a vampire tale that sinks deep beneath the skin. After being stabbed by his assistant with an ancient knife, notable anthropologist Dr Hess Green is transformed into an immortal being who is compelled to drink blood. Falling in love with his assistant’s wife, Ganja, he decides to bestow on her the gift of immortality. Named one of the best films of the decade at Cannes in 1973, ‘Ganja & Hess’ is an artistic and bizarre film that is full of symbolic imagery, abstract philosophical concepts and challenging ideas of sex, religion and cultural and racial identity. 

Next up will be Stuart Gordon’s ‘Re-Animator’, a classic of '80s horror which perfectly blends horror and humour to tell the story of a scientist who invents a solution which can bring living tissue back to life. Loosely based on H. P. Lovecraft's episodic novella Herbert West–Reanimator and inspired by Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, this outrageously gory and comedic film is sure to entertain.

Right after the GM, we'll be screening David Lynch's bizarro cult classic WILD AT HEART
_______________________________________
Dir. David Lynch - 1990 - USA

WILD AT HEART stars Nic Cage and Laura Dern as Sailor and Lula, two young lovers who embark on a cross-country road trip, pursued by a rogues gallery of menacing weirdos that Lula’s mother has hired to kill Sailor.  The film won the Palme d’Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival and it was certainly a bold choice.  By turns hilarious and horrifying, with an on-point soundtrack, a colourful cast of characters, occasional references to the Wizard of Oz, and show-stopping performances delivered by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, this is David Lynch at his most flamboyantly strange and deliriously entertaining.  Oh, and if you’ve ever wanted to see Nic croon along to Elvis, then this is the movie for you.  Come along for a crime thriller-comedy-musical-road movie like no other.

The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film a few years back and Mads Mikkelsen (of Hannibal and Casino Royale fame in the US) took home a Cannes best actor award for his phenomenal performance as Lucas. It's a heart-breaking, nuanced film, and certainly not one you want to miss.

It's a film full of intriguing revelations, so we won't spoil anything further...  However, we can tell you that DUKE's impeccable, lush cinematography and its hauntingly lovely soundtrack make this a sensory experience to be remembered and revisited.

Welcome to FilmSoc for 2016.

We’re kicking off the year by spending a few days in the cap-toe leather shoes of Manhattan businessman-cum-psychopath Patrick Bateman. Adapted from Brett Easton Ellis’ infamous novel, American Psycho went criminally underappreciated in 1999 but has since lingered in the minds of sadists and cult aficionados alike. Led by a chilling yet hilarious performance by Christian Bale, this subversive horror-comedy is a must-see portrait of 80’s excess.

FilmSoc screened Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s masterpiece Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall Past Lives as our final film last year, though it has often been considered inferior to the more personal, intimate and innovative Tropical Malady, which Weerasethakul released 10 years ago.

Tropical Malady evokes the same trademark surrealism as the filmmakers later works, however, it is more reflective of Weerasethakul’s background as an experimental queer filmmaker, as well as well as his relationship with his Thai heritage and culture. Tropical Malady is a very rare film, and without a doubt one of the most important films of the last ten years.

***DESCRIPTION***
dir. Claire Denis - 2008 - France

Claire Denis is one of the pre-eminent figures of contemporary world cinema, with films concerned with family and relationships as well as cross-cultural tensions, stemming from her colonial African background which informs her work.

35 Shots of Rum is arguably her masterpiece, and perhaps the best example of her work as associated with that nebulous term of ‘contemplative cinema’ – films of great subtlety, long take aesthetic, mood and showing rather than telling – and the most obvious nod to Yasujiro Ozu, the great master that is perhaps her greatest influence, in its ostensible reworking of Late Spring (which we are screening in Week 11). The masterfully woven tale of a father and daughter’s changing relationship is both simple in plot and expansive and affecting in its implications and feeling, an instant classic of French cinema.",Old Geology Lecture Theatre,Sydney,Australia,,2006.0,-33.88486413,151.1876865,2075,17:00:00+1000,2014-09-24,1
1141,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Annual General Meeting 2014,18,4,35,0,4,61,"It's that time of year again when FilmSoc's members gather together to reminisce over the semesters gone by and to democratically decide who will be running the society in 2015.  If you want to be more involved with Sydney's biggest and best student film society, then we'd love to see you put your hand up for one of the available exec positions.

POSITIONS TO BE ELECTED, in the following order: 
-President
-Vice-President
-Secretary
-Treasurer
-Events Officer
-Sponsorship Officer
-4 x General Executive

Full agenda and details on what each position involves will be issued shortly.

Bear in mind that you can nominate yourself for more than one position, but if you are elected to one of the positions, you cannot run for the subsequent ones.  (e.g. if you nominate for Secretary, but you don't win that round, then you can still nominate for any of the subsequent positions. However, if your nomination is successful, you can't then run to be an Events Officer, and so on.)

Also, if you can't come to the meeting, don't worry: you can submit your nomination in advance by sending us an email (usydfilmsoc@gmail.com) with your name, Access card number, and the position(s) you are nominating for.
You can also send us a few words about why you'd be a good fit for that position/why you'd like to be more involved with FilmSoc/any ideas that you have for the society that we can read to the meeting in your absence (optional).

After the meeting, we'll be holding our screening of 35 SHOTS OF RUM, along with pizza and drinks as usual.",Old Geology Lecture Theatre,Sydney,Australia,,2006.0,-33.88486413,151.1876865,2075,17:00:00+1000,2014-09-24,1
1142,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Week 8: Pariah,9,3,39,0,3,54,"dir. Dee Rees - 2011 - USA

PARIAH focuses on a 17-year-old African American girl called Alike who lives in Brooklyn and who comes to terms with and embraces her sexuality.  It’s as much about expression as it is repression, and while it’s co-funded by Spike Lee, it’s written and directed by first-time filmmaker Dee Rees, whose story Alike’s is inspired by. Come along to Old Geo at 5 this Wednesday to see a film that broaches intersectional issues of race, gender and sexuality with nuance and charm.

Food and drinks will be had from 5pm and the screening will start at 5:15pm.",Old Geology Lecture Theatre,Sydney,Australia,,2006.0,-33.88486413,151.1876865,2075,17:00:00+1000,2014-09-17,1
1144,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Week 6: CLOSE-UP,5,2,39,0,2,48,"dir. Abbas Kiarostami - 1990 - Iran

Close-Up has got to be one of the most dazzling films to emerge from the Iranian New Wave, a movement known for films that are intellectually challenging and conceptually ambitious, yet deceptively simple and elegant in execution.

Based on a real-life case, its narrative focuses on a man who is put on trial for impersonating a famous filmmaker.  We are swiftly notified that we are watching a blend of documentary and fiction, a sort of dramatised re-enactment in which every person involved in the original events plays themself.

By blurring the boundaries between reality and re-construction, Kiarostami’s film develops into a playfully self-reflexive and quietly engrossing inquiry into the nature of the cinematic image itself - a treat for any cinephile.

See this insane film with us in Old Geo from 5:15pm, with food 'n' drinks beforehand and lively discussion afterwards.",Old Geology Lecture Theatre,Sydney,Australia,,2006.0,-33.88486413,151.1876865,2075,17:00:00+1000,2014-09-03,1
1145,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Week 5: Z,13,7,31,0,7,58,"dir. Costa-Gavras - 1969 - France/Algeria
******
If you feeling like working up some political outrage on a Wednesday evening, then come along to our screening of Z.  Drawing heavily from an actual incident that occurred in Greece in 1963, this French-language film portrays the events following the assassination of a prominent politician, tracing a young magistrate’s attempts to uncover the evidence that will allow him to apprehend those responsible.

It’s not hard to see why Z was an international box office hit in its time – it’s a perfectly paced, stylishly directed political thriller underpinned by a blood-boiling story of corruption and conspiracy that maintains its potency today.

1147,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Week 4: Lore,19,5,57,0,5,86,"[dir. Cate Shortland - 2012 - Australia/Germany]

Lore is a bildungsroman from an unconventional perspective, set in the aftermath of WWII. After her Nazi parents are captured by the Allied forces, a young girl, Lore, is tasked with taking her siblings through the Black Forest to their grandmother's house. What unfolds is Lore’s realisation of the terrifying disjunct between insular propaganda and the world as it is. In the hands of Australian filmmaker, Cate Shortland, Lore proves to be a poetic and subtly disturbing tale of the dissolution of innocence.

This should be gr8. 5pm pizza and drinks. 5.15pm Screening starts. And afterwards we can swing by the flodge, grab $9 jugs and talk about our feelings.
