Joel knows consulting. After graduating he spent time with Grant Thornton's Recovery and Reorganisation team, and Deloitte's Strategy and Operations team, before beginning his career at EY in Performance and Improvement Advisory. He is one of EY's best internally-rated consultants, with experience in Education, Construction, Financial Services and Healthcare. He is eager to share the process he pursued in one of his engagements, to give us insight into how great consultants work. His advice will be invaluable to students who want to stand out in their applications to work in financial services.
 
He has paused his career at EY to work as General Manager of Nexus Notes, where he oversees a peer-to-peer marketplace used by ~1.5 million University students across Australia and New Zealand to sell and buy summary notes. It's a profitable startup turning over 150k in revenue per year, with 10K users already on the platform internationally. In 2015, it received seed funding through Australia's leading accelerator 'Startmate' which is backed by Blackbird Ventures. Later in 2015 the founders pitched on SharkTank AU. The venture was co-founded at Sydney University and Sydney remains the largest market to date. Students who have put effort into their notes can make easy money and also benefit from mentoring opportunities, job references and access to exclusive events and networking sessions with access to major commercial and legal firms.
 
Joel will be providing unique end to end insight into how a successful project is run at a consulting firm, by breaking down the process and highlighting the various stages of preparing a deliverable. He will also be highlighting how best to take advantage of great opportunities through Nexus Notes. The workshop will be interactive and audience participation is expected!

Put on some Go Go boots, grease up your hair, rediscover your mojo and get into the 70s flair.

REGISTRATIONS ARE NOW OPEN: t.uber.com/launchchallenge

❂ ❂ ❂ 

Uber launched in San Francisco in 2010. Today, they've helped over 2 billion people reach their destination in 450+ cities around the world.

The Uber Launch Challenge invites all University of Sydney students in teams of 2-3 to pitch an expansion strategy for real-life Uber products, as Uber continues to evolve the way cities move.

The winning team from each Campus Heat will receive an all expense paid trip to our Australian Regional Headquarters in Sydney and the opportunity to pitch to the Uber Leadership Team.

THE CHALLENGE:
The Uber Launch Challenge 2017 theme is ‘Shared Rides’

From Sydney to São Paulo, we’ve been working hard to get to know our cities, with the goal of making them safer, smarter, more accessible and less congested. Our bold experiments in shared rides technology are making this mission a reality, with products including uberPOOL, uberHOP and uberCOMMUTE.

The Challenge places you on the frontline as we launch these products in new markets. Teams will be given the opportunity to:
- Analyse demand and supply levers, turning raw data into actionable insights; 
- Define a launch strategy and incentive scheme to encourage early adoption and rapid growth of both driver-partners and riders; 
- Build a business model, optimising Uber’s core metrics to ensure operational excellence at scale.

THE PRIZES:
The Campus Heat winners will receive an all expense paid trip to Sydney to compete in the Finals on 20th May. The top three teams will be awarded up to $1,500 in Uber rides or UberEATS credits, and the first place team will earn guaranteed interviews for the 2018 Uber Graduate Program.

The Challenge is open to students at all universities across Australia and New Zealand, with Campus Heats taking place at the following universities: University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, University of Adelaide, Australian National University, University of Western Australia, and University of Auckland.

BUT don’t speed dial your therapist just yet! Because Daddy is out of town, and left the keys to his yacht in the glove box of the Porsche Macan parked downstairs…

Sydney University Business Society is proud to present: ‘Daddy’s Yacht Party; a Celebration of Parental Dependency’.

Gents, think Jay Gatsby class and effortless smoulders. It’s certainly going to be a night to remember... or not ;)

*************************************

Ladies and gentlemen of business schools and other faculties around NSW (yes, tonight we'll let it slide and accept you as one of us). As the dark cloud, better known as Semester 2 looms and begins to cast its shadow, we at SUBS feel that something must be done. 

So, in heroic business student fashion, we have decided to take ownership of this 
abhorrent responsibility. Let us take action and rise above this ominous fog that is Semester 2. Let us get ridiculously turned up. Let us rebel against the system and prove that we can and will party like the future CEOs.

What is expected:

- LOTS of camo and other military themed outfits. Dress up people. Now is not the time to be afraid. Embrace the camo. 

- 'Sun's out, gun's out' is a policy that we're going to have to enforce--sorry. It may be winter, and it will be night time, but all you bronzed beauties that have just arrived back from Europe and successfully teased us Sydneysiders with your 24-7 Insta updates, it's time to take one for the team. We don't care if it's 10C. Guns out people, guns out. 

- Shots shall be fired all night long. Just as Lionel Richie always intended.

As a continuation on the Monday Law Career Basics Panel, 'All the light touches – grappling with the legal landscape', this Wednesday Panel will focus on building skills and relationships in your legal career, whether in your part-time job or grad job. 

Presented by Kate Samolej, the first half of the panel discussion will focus on developing skills in the following areas:
1. Developing a reading and writing style of a legal practitioner.
2. Developing a feel for junior court appearances
3. Building relationships with other practitioners and the Counsel/Solicitor relationship

The panel will then discuss how to take advantage of these skills, especially when it comes to utilising them to form relationships. If you are a quiet achiever, this event will especially help you as we will talk about how to best develop yourself and your network if you are more introverted as we will delve into ""law for the soft spoken”/introvert v extrovert themes.

Finally, the panel will help dissipate the idea that marks are everything, and prove that life (and employment) does happen without a distinction average.

Our Panellists include:
Meher Gaven – Barrister, Eight Wentworth Chambers
Renée Bianchi – Barrister, 13th Floor St James Hall Chambers, Chair of the Young Lawyers Committee of the Law Council of Australia 
Beverly Parungao – Paralegal at Jones Day, formerly Legal Assistant at 12 Wentworth Selborne Chambers 
Elizabeth Toriola – Paralegal at Corrs Chambers Westgarth, formerly Legal Assistant at 12 Wentworth Selborne Chambers

Lunch will be provided.

100,SydneyUniversityLawSociety,SULS Presents: PLT Day,49,46,308,0,46,449,"So you're probably at the point in your life where you're thinking two things: 1) the phrase ""legal profession"" enlivens a deep trauma that can only be added to by the words ""take home""; and 2) now that i've (nearly) got my law degree, what do I do next? 

Your Practising Certificate is the next step in your legal training, and a competency requirement to be admitted as a solicitor in New South Wales. Lucky for you we're making learning about that next step a whole bunch of fun - with the brand new PLT Day held on Tuesday of Week 12 from 1pm to 3pm. A range of PLT providers will be coming in to discuss their programs and how customisable and flexible they are for students of all needs. 

So drop into the law foyer and listen to the presentations (from 1pm to 1:30pm). After that, all our providers will hang around until 3pm to answer whatever questions you have for them (there's free tea and snacks). 

N.B. Whilst students who choose to work with a commercial firm will sometimes have their PLT provided in the course of employment, many (traditionally smaller) firms do not offer this.  If you're looking to work for a barrister, government, a judicial representative, it's likely you'll have to arrange your own PLT training. Additionally, if you're thinking of working in another industry, with the thought of potentially going into legal practice later, you should be aware of the 5 year ""stale-degree"" rule that requires you to be admitted within 5 years of graduating your law degree. 

We look forward to seeing as many people as possible at PLT Day to help you decide how to best progress your legal education!",2017-10-24T13:00:00+1100,Law Lounge,,,,,,,0.0,0.0

It will feature a diverse panel of individuals who have achieved success in their professional careers, and have extensive personal experience with ethnocultural issues in the workforce. 

While Australia has an impressive and increasingly significant multicultural foundation, it is evident that this is not reflected in the composition of senior leaders in business and legal professions. This event is designed to explore the cultural barriers people of colour may still face in the legal sector. 

Many law firms have robust programs to support and promote the role of wom*n and LGBTQ+ people in their communities, and many are committed to Reconciliation Action Plans - but to what extent is the Australian legal profession aware of and committed to addressing intersections of disadvantage, prejudice, unconscious bias, and resultant lack of diverse representation amongst its members? To what extent is race a barrier, and how is it addressed? 

The evening will include a Q&A session where students can raise any personal queries and the latter half of the evening will be a networking night. 

Our panelists include: 
Lisa Annese (CEO of Diversity Council Australia)
Chris Ronalds SC (Chair of the NSW Indigenous Bar Association’s Indigenous Barristers Strategy Working Party) 
Dai Le (Founder of Developing Culturally Diverse Leadership (DAWN))
Penina Su (Final year LLB student at Sydney Law School and Summer Clerk / Paralegal at Herbert Smith Freehills)

Simba, we'll show you the legal lay of the land.

Presented by Kate Samolej, this event is intended to provide students with and understanding of the legal landscape. SULS Careers will be inviting ex-student panellists who have work experience outside of the clerkship context, such as volunteers, small firms, courts, chambers and in-house, and can de-mystify what these roles entail as well as provide tips about how to successfully apply to and work in the profession.

Our lunchtime panel will share their experiences of starting out and advise the audience on “how to ask” – where to look, who to speak to, and how to gather the courage to aim a little bit higher than you think your CV might allow you to. We'll also highlight the importance of finding out what your goals are and deciding on the kind of workplace that best suits you, as well as showcasing that small firms are not synonymous with wills, conveyances and “small things”, but rather there is a wealth of boutique firms out there who undertake exciting work.

Finally, this seminar will touch on how to form relationships - how to get noticed, start getting out of your shell and how to grow your interaction with other practitioners over time, which is a vital skill for aspiring law students. This last point will be expanded in our second Law Career Basics Seminar, 'Little steps – Building skills and relationships' on Wednesday 25th of October from 1-2pm in the Law Foyer. 

Lunch will be provided. If you can’t make this event, please attend our Wednesday panel. Although in includes slightly different content, you will have the opportunity to ask about the same topics, and you will be able to meet esteemed barristers!

Our panellists include:
- Georgia Allen: Intern at the Australian Law Reform Commission, Constitutional Reform Unit, Research Assistant at the Judicial Conference of Australia

- Tiarne Wadey: Paralegal, Office of General Counsel University of Sydney

- Abi Smith: Dispatch Officer at NSW Police Force, Paralegal in Barrister Chambers, currently Paralegal at Djekovic Hearne and Walker Solicitors

103,SydneyUniversityLawSociety,SULS Social Justice Conference 2017: Beyond the Buzzword,58,74,519,0,74,725,"The Sydney University Law Society invites you to attend its annual Social Justice Conference for 2017 - BEYOND THE BUZZWORD: SOCIAL JUSTICE IN PRACTICE. 

This one-day conference will seek to provide guidance in exploring the multiple career and life pathways that are available to 'social justice'-minded students after university. What more is there, practically speaking, behind that buzzword? It will encourage you to think critically about the sort of impact you are really having on your way to enacting pragmatic, productive and long-term social justice initiatives.

With a stellar line-up of speakers over the course of the day, we hope to delve into some of the trickier questions about practising 'social justice' as activists and lawyers-in-waiting, such as:

- How do we ensure not-for-profit organisations are culturally sensitive and providing long-term solutions? 
- What role, if any, does the private sector play in facilitating access to justice? Is this sustainable? Is it good?
- Is 'Corporate Social Responsibility' just good marketing? Is it real? Is it helpful?
- What is the difference between Legal Aid and Community Legal Centres? 
- Are some of these organisations redundant in providing social justice or do they each have a genuine role to play? How could they be better? How can we?
- What does it mean to be 'culturally competent'? Why is it important?
- What can students do, whilst they're at university, to prepare themselves for careers in the 'social justice' or 'public interest' sectors?
- What jobs are out there? What should we be looking for?

To mix things up, lunch and afternoon tea will be catered by the excellent PARLIAMENT ON KING - a local social enterprise providing delish, diverse foods whilst training refugees, asylum seekers, and recent arrivals to Australia to work in hospitality. 

Spots are very limited - so to secure your place (and your lunch), please register as soon as possible via the following link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10eYCAmoqGS9ddCPh42PnohKV1KaTOcFf89n-mZh2AXc/viewform?edit_requested=true

Over three weeks in Semester 2, it provides a snapshot of some of the careers available in the 'social justice sector' and insight into how students can pursue opportunities with these organisations (both whilst studying and thereafter). 

Come along to hear from some of the most influential organisations working at the very forefront of social justice in our society, whether they be community legal centres fighting for equal access to justice, governmental bodies deciding policies which govern our civil and human rights, or NGOs working in the international sphere.

We encourage you to drop by even if just to take advantage of the free pizza/sandwiches or, in Week 10, to hear from Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher AM (President of the Australian Human Rights Commission; former President of the Australian Law Reform Commission).

We’ve put the Lunchtime Series together with students across all years in mind - so expect to hear and ask questions about internship, graduate and volunteering opportunities alike.

This is an excellent opportunity to talk with representatives from state and commonwealth government bodies, community legal centres, pro bono teams, NGOs, and other social justice organisations, and to hear about the volunteer, internship or graduate programs they have on offer. 

Students from all years (i.e. not just penultimate) are encouraged to come along and hear about how they can get involved with social justice work both during their studies and after they graduate. For those students who ARE interested in applying for clerkships or corporate grad programs later on in their degrees, getting involved in volunteer work at, for example, a Community Legal Centre is still a fantastic way to get practical legal experience and develop your skills whilst making a tangible, positive contribution to the local community. 

This year, SULS is excited to present our LARGEST EVER Careers Fair - with over 30 organisations having confirmed their attendance. These include:

2. If you've heard the whispers around campus about the ultimate Halloween party and you're looking out for the best way to kick  the Semester into the harbour, then hold on to your knickers, briefs, boxers, panties, undies or other undergarments because Thursday 26 October brings the biggest, baddest and most rambunctious event OF THE YEAR!!!

Did we mention it's on a boat??? 3 hours cruising around Sydney harbour with 700 students while taking in the sights.... While on a boat.... For 3 hours.... In Halloween attire. Ahhhh yes please!!

Q) So how do I get a ticket? A) Unlike our other parties tickets to the boat cruise can only be bought online and THEY ARE LIMITED! We can't stress this enough guys, seen too many people miss out and have to spend their night crying in bed, cuddling their cats and listening to Adele.

In a matter of mere months you could be spanning the Tasman with 140 of the rowdiest, most rambunctious kids to have walk this fine earth. That is Middle Earth, of course. 

Unlike the other inferior copies you may have seen floating around (we're looking at you MacAlpine) SUBSKI's ORIGINAL Tour of Duty offers the following...

Scenery fit for Frodo and his merry men, 10 unforgettable days... 4 mountains... all flights and transfers included... themed parties EVERY night... enough pre drinks and bar tabs to fuel a Russian family of three (that's a lot!), transport erry'day AND pre arranged lift passes to make sure your sorry, hung over ass makes it to the slopes (oh stop it SUBSKI, you're so generous).

Whether you're a novice and have never seen snow before or an Olympic hopeful, SUBSKI will cater to you and make sure you have the GREATEST 10 DAYS OF YOUR LIFE!

STILL need convincing? Check out our video below to get a taste of what our trips can offer!

If skiing is not your thing, or you hit it just a touch too hard the night before, Queenstown is an awesome town to visit, with SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES! Adrenaline Junkies - think bungy jumping, sky diving, nevis swing and more. For those of you with a healthy respect for life, why not try ice skating, horse riding, cafe hopping or give Queenstown's world famous (in New Zealand) putt putt course a go. If that's not your thing then…why not start pre drinking early? It's 5 somewhere right? 

Alright alright, so we’ve established that we like to party and we’re rather partial to the snow, but here’s the deets...

The trip runs 12th – 21st JULY and is open to ANYONE regardless of uni (we don't discriminate, we're good like that).

This includes:
flights and transfers to and from Queenstown
9 nights accommodation
6 days skiing on 4 mountains
Discounted ski hire (or snowboard gear if you're that way inclined)
Themed parties every night
Lot's of hotties
Massive bar tabs at all our favourite bars

and a hot tub... wait did we mention hotties?

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

Dress up as whatever you dreamed of becoming as a kid, get down and party your way into Summer 2016/17!

And, unfortunately, we must accept that reality has crashed back down to earth faster than a one armed brick-layer in Baghdad. PTD or post trip depression is a serious problem. Common symptoms include nostalgia to the point of tears, serious illness from being run-down and separation anxiety from the people you travelled with. There is however a cure: welcome all to The Clinic - SUBSKI's 3rd Party. The theme, as a way of preventing the harshness of the real world is ""Out Of This World"", at Kit & Kaboodle, Thursday in Week 2 of Ew(U)ni.

We prescribe killer medications in DJ Bronx & Co all night, $5 drinks, complimentary Captain Morgan's on arrival included in ticket price. Our prescriptions, a.k.a. tickets, cost a measly $5 for Access members, and $10 for non-Access members, so bring your friends! Come and share your weird stories from holidays or brag about how you have such a better start to uni because you've spent the last 4 weeks preparing at home. Regardless, get involved, a fun night will most certainly be had by all. Doors open at 8pm.

We will hopefully have Auslan interpreters available on the night - stay tuned for details. All visual material will endeavour to use large, clear fonts and subtitles.

This event is fragrance free. Please avoid the use of strong and/or aerosolised scents (e.g. perfume or scented lotion) to accommodate the needs of people with hypersensory issues or allergic reactions. If this is a concern or you have any questions please contact the event organisers.

The venue is ten minutes’ walk or wheel from Sydenham station, and from Sydenham station you can also get the M30 bus to just opposite the venue. The Red Rattler is also accessible by buses that go along Victoria Road, Marrickville (423, 426, M30).There is plenty of space out front for taxis/ubers to pull in and drop people off, and there is parking available.

More detailed access info to be posted in the event page below. If you have any queries about accessibility, or have specific accessibility requirements that aren’t covered by the information above, please feel free to contact the event organisers. You can reach Robin at robin.m.eames@gmail.com.

Come along one and all to the most fantastic and exciting social event of your journey through university. 

After you've completed just over 2 weeks of your baby steps into the University of Sydney we thought you'd appreciate the opportunity to get out of your comfort zone, broaden your horizon and generally ruin more cliches. 

Most importantly it is the best time to meet some new friends who you may share subjects with or even be part of the same niche society you forgot you signed up to during O Week. The SASS team wants to embrace students from the entire faculty whether you do Government, Gender Studies, Economics or Languages (and many more!). Even if you haven't decided what you want to specialise in, come along to Arts Camp to discover new people and new experiences! 

We'll be catching a bus down from the University quadrangle to our favourite campground on Friday afternoon and returning on Sunday afternoon. The days and nights will be filled with activities and a chance to socialise including our famous dance party on the last night with the theme of 'I can't believe you wore that!'. 

Alcohol will be provided*, although the event IS open to all ages (you youngun's under-18 won't be allowed to drink ofc). Camp Leaders from the 2017 Executive of SASS will be responsible for student's welfare and safety throughout the camp. 

Hit up this event or our facebook page here https://www.facebook.com/sydneyartssociety/ or email our President, Jacob Masina, sydneyarts.president@gmail.com if you have any questions!

Buses will leave from the front of the Quad at 2pm SHARP. So please gather there at 1 latest.

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

Dress up as whatever you dreamed of becoming as a kid, get down and party your way into Summer 2016/17!

We know you're looking for a chance to celebrate the end of a flat out, ball-busting semester full of soy chai latte sipping and philosophical dissertations. We know you're hoping for an unforgettable night that you honestly probably will have trouble remembering (cos you gotta clear out some space in the memory bank to make room for last minute finals cramming, right?). And we know you're looking to do it all in style on a sick cruise with an even sicker light show in the background. 

This year we're still giving you a chance to get a lil dressed up, but we wanna spice it up and get VIVID as well. So break out your cocktail dress and button-up + blazer, but don't be afraid to throw in some colour as well - the more VIVID the better! 

So join us on June 2 (Thursday of the last week of semester!) for what's sure to be a spectacularly SASSy time. There'll be banging tunes, good food, A STEADY SUPPLY OF FREE ALC, a sweet DF and all your favourite SASSy mates. Tickets have sold out FAST in the past, so get on it asap. You won't wanna miss this. 

WHEN: Thursday, 2nd June, 7:45pm-11:45pm. Arrive at 7:15pm ON THE DOT for a 7:45pm SHARP departure. 
WHERE: King Street Wharf (Wharf No. 7) 
PRICE: $40.50 (ACCESS), $50.50 (NON-ACCESS)

We called up our friends at Young Vinnies, SASS, and SUEUA and told them of our vision. At first they were afraid. Could it be done? Could we build a kingdom of wishes and dreams? 

The University of Sydney Union answered, “YES! OH GOD, YES!”

So, for one night only, the Holme Student Lounge is being transformed into Fort Holme as we build the biggest blanket fort you’ve ever seen. Once it is deemed structurally sound, you’ll be invited inside for Operation Slumber Party. There will be pizza, hot cocoa, and Disney! 

Once all the goss about hot boys is exhausted and the fort has been dismantled, all the blankets will be donated to the Vinnies Winter Appeal!

We’re (out)BACK to Sem, and this time we’re kicking it off in true Aussie style. Whip out your akubras, RM’s and flannies for an outback adventure on which Russell Coight himself would froth. First Thursday of Semester come on down to The Two Wolves Cantina, where you won’t need to worry about a dingo eating your baby, only the food baby born of unlimited Tacos. Down, down, prices are DOWN af, and we’re boopin so many $5 shots of Tequila* it’s gonna leave you heckin’ bamboozled.

Brought to you by the Movers and Shakers, BAMSOC and Flairsoc, this night will be a lit outback sesh, with fresh produce from our humble farmers, including unlimited home grown organic Little Fat Lambs.  With an alleged appearance from Clive Palmer’s PUPs and Barnaby Joyce’s chins, we’ve gone into the bush to dig up the most dangerous and witchetty-grubby night imaginable. Take a moment to step away from your everyday urban horrors- compulsory tutes, bin chickens, and UTS- and step into our new home to enjoy the serenity. It’s a night that’s going straight in the pool room, so don’t miss out!

“STRUTH,” you exclaim, “$25 for a ticket?? Tell him he’s dreamin!” But rest assured, you’ve gotta lift to be game for a night like this: Unlimited Little Fat Lamb, Unlimited Tacos, and a fuck-tonne of banter. After we’ve silenced all of the lambs, kick on with us to Scary Canary for some true blue Scary jars and some good old line dancing. Get that last plane into Sydney, and stack up those dollarydoos xoxo.

Usyd lost it's Jacaranda, America has lot the plot, but your friend from UTS is still yet to lose his virginity; so let's make it all better with the most lit party since the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, roasting all of your mates for everything they've done in 2016.

In a Party more red hot than the finale of the Bachelor, we are set to host a night of emails you'll just have to delete, and snapchats Taylor Swift will say she never agreed to. Incollaboration with 8 societies from both USYD and UNSW, so it'll be the best night out to meet new people and just grab em by the wet pussy shot they're about to do!

So come dressed as your favourite emoji, and pray that this time when your crush sees it you're not going to get friendzoned again. It's gonna be the longest yeah boiiiiiii ever.

We're going to bring you $10 Cocktail specials and pizza platters all night. It's value so good if you leave it at home with Kim Kardashian someone's going to tie her up and steal it.

1. Unfortunately Subski & Bamsoc aren't having a boat cruise this year because we actually hate having fun and Halloween sucks....

2. You've heard the whispers around campus, you've been thinking for months now about the ultimate Halloween costume and you're looking out for the best way to metaphorically kick Semester 2 into the harbour... or literally if you see fit.

Well hold on to your knickers, briefs, boxers, panties, undies or other undergarments because the 20th of October brings the biggest, baddest, most rambunctious event OF THE YEAR!!!

Did we mention it's on a boat??? 3 hours cruising around Sydney harbor, taking in the sights and being totally respectful (ha!) to your liver, brain cells and everything 2016 had to offer.... While on a boat.... For 3 hours.... With drinks.... In Halloween attire. Ahhhh yes please!!

Q) So how do I get a ticket? A) Unlike our other parties tickets to the boat cruise can only be bought online and THEY ARE LIMITED! We can't stress this enough guys, seen too many people miss out and have to spend their night crying in bed, cuddling their cats and listening to Adele. 

FINAL RELEASE TICKETS - $45

DEPARTURE: The boat will depart 6:30 promptly from the King St Wharf right outside Cargo Bar and will not wait for you. So DON’T BE LATE, or you'll be swimming. Aim to get there a bit earlier so you can board with ease and check out all the sexy Halloween costumes!

MUSIC: We'll have our very own Dj's providing you with next level beats from their pc computers and keeping the d floor raging until the very last person steps off the boat.

AFTER PARTY: Naturally the After Party will be taking place at Cargo Bar, which will be directly in front of you as you stumble off the boat. Nice and easy even if you are directionally challenged by that point. Oh also your wristband will get you cheaper drinks, yay!

Now that's about it so grab yourself a ticket and get excited for the greatest night of the semester, the year and possibly even all time! Yeeeww

Ladies and Gentlemen, much like a successful tune for our society president Edwin Ho, the first event on the BAMSOC calendar has been a long time coming. There will be cheek, there will be Nandos, there will be banter.

There'll be hot chicks, glazed at 420 degrees and seasoned rare with Pepe-Pepe sauce. Not only is this a feast for all the senses but short of completing FIFA 17 and starting a riot, cheeky nandos with the lads and lasses is as quintessentially British as the Queen.

Ever wondered what it would be like to be a celebrity like Ed Sheeran or Example? Wonder no more with Bamsoc acting as your own personal black card selling chicken skewers at $1, mini burgers at $3, veggie wraps at $2 and spirit vouchers at $4.

WHERE: Eastern Avenue, University of Sydney
WHEN: 10am-3pm, Thursday 7th May 2015

Please come down and support the cause! ALL donations goes towards the Nepal Earthquake Relief funds. 

If you cannot make it on the day, please feel free to donate to our Everyday Hero page on World Vision Australia, there is no minimum amount and all funds will be directly sent to World Vision Australia! 
https://nepalappeal2015.everydayhero.com/au/fabsoc-for-nepal


FABSOC (Fashion & Beauty Appreciation Society) is aiming to raise at least $1,000 and clothing donations, where 100% of donations raised will assist orphanages, organisations, hospitals and families in receiving the required treatment, equipment and funding needed to rebuild their lives and help Nepal. We will be donating 100% of funds to World Vision Australia where they will distribute funds accordingly. 

At FABSOC, we aim to use fashion as a segue for good causes and charitable work, as well as promote self-confidence and awareness through fashion. Through our fundraiser, we aim to promote our philanthropist nature and humanitarian values to help Nepal overcome this natural disaster, where a tumultuous earthquake of a magnitude of 7.9 struck Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal on the 25th April 2015. 

So far there have been over 6,000 deaths and an exponential amount of casualties and injuries. Nepal has a population of 27.8 Million people, where 50% of it's population are young children under the age of 18. Due to the increasing number of casualties, hundreds of thousands of children have been critically injured, separated from their families or are still trapped beneath the rubble and debris. Nepal as a nation has always suffered from impoverishment, governmental issues and a lack of infrastructure, due to this it's important to keep in mind that Nepal is desperately struggling during this time due to its LEDC status. 

Please keep Nepal in your hearts at this turbulent time, any donations, items of clean clothing or words of support is encouraged and welcomed.

The week after LOCUS (when we're all feeling the post-show comedown) is ALSO the first week of the Revue Season! So what better way to get our fixes than to go see some comedy on campus!

'What is a revue?' you may ask.

'Well, young Padawan, a revue is a sketch comedy show, packed to the brim with sketches that will make your sides split, great music theatre dancing and extraordinary musical comedy!'

'So how do I go?' you ask.

'WELL, you can check out the faculty revue Facebook event links below! And the night MADSOC will be attending next to it.'

To book your ticket, you can either use the link provided and book it through Seymour, OR if you want to sit with the rest of the MADSOC group, tick the box on the poll below. Keep an eye on Alysha Harrold's posts as she'll be booking the group tickets and it is her you will have to transfer the $$ to (if there are more then 10 in the group booking you get a discount!)

Artistic Director: Bec Clare
Producer: Gaby Boulos
Cast: 83 brilliant talented dancers

Sydney Uni's Movement & Dance Society has produced some quality productions over its few years in existence, but this show promises to be the biggest and best yet! 

LOCUS explores the personal growth and the masks people make for themselves. This investigation into the inner and outer depicts the circumstances, lifestyles, occassions, themes and emotions that shape people's lives, and celebrates the contribution of those events to the formation of the individual.
 
So whether you're a dance-lover, a dance-appreciator or know nothing about dance at all, come to experience Locus and enjoy the way our stories can be expressed through dance.
We've got you covered from contemporary, jazz, ballet to tap, hip hop, cha cha, Bollywood, and even some sick beat poetry.

And it’s going to go off. What better way to end the semester than with a rager of a night with your fav dancing peeps?

The theme is ‘The Final Countdown’. So, basically it’s the last night on Earth, civilisation is crumbling all around us and you have ONE last crazy night to live it up… WHAT and WHO will you be? You decide how you want to spend your final night and what style/impression you want to give off. That could be reliving the glory days of your 90s pop childhood, or digging out that dusty flapper tap costume you once danced in… Or it could just be coming in your birthday suit… ya know, you do you! But whatever it is, make it count! This theme can literally encompass everything and anything, so if you’re thinking right now “ooh I don’t know about that.. does it even fit?” “Will I look weird?” “people won’t get this”…. JUST DO ITTTTT. We dare you. 

So, this epic party is in a few weeks (the Friday of week 13) and it’s taking place at none other than the Red Rattler Theatre in Marrickville, which for those of you who don’t know is the sickest, and grooviest venue EVERRR.

Well, fear not friends, in two Tuesdays time (week 13) MADSOC will be grooving on down to Establishment Bar on George Street for a fierce night of Salsa Dancing to the “sexiest Latin beats” Sydney has to offer, and $12 Mojitos! I repeat, $12 Mojitos. And if that doesn’t add flavor to your life, I don’t know what will. 

So, details, on Tuesday the 27th, the actual salsa lesson starts at 8pm, but we shall meet there at 7pm so we can down as many drinks as possible beforehand to make up for the fact that our hips DO NOT in fact lie… Shakira was wrong. 

Further info here: http://merivale.com.au/whats-on/event/celebrate-all-things-salsa/

Also, added bonus, we will be meeting at 6pm beforehand for food/nibbles. Two options here: either we can get food at Establishment; they have a cute (and surprisingly not too expensive) snacks menu, that has like burgers, chips, dips and bread, etc OR we could go to Frankie’s Pizza (on Hunter Street, around the corner) for pizza and the best apple vodka’s eva. Frankie’s is a super chill and cool bar, and it suits our budget (LOL #studentlyfe #igotyourbacksguys). Let me know your preferences for either of those of you're planning on coming beforehand :) Establishment is more convenient but pizzzzaaaa?

For some Latin inspiration, check this out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uqkRpOHnUk

So please join us for what is sure to be a saucy and steamy* evening, AND spice up ya life! 

P.s. I promise to dance with anyone who doesn’t have a partner if you buy me a mojito.

MADSOC, SUDS, SURCAS and MUSE are proud to present The Stroke of Midnight: The 2014 Performing Arts Ball.

Following in the successes of 2013, the premier evening for performing arts on campus is here again to celebrate those who persist in (magically) wasting their time on stages. It’s a splendid excuse to get into obnoxious costume and rub elbows with those others at Sydney who hone themselves as entertainers – the nearest thing to real magic we have.

Of all the venues alluded to in the moving fables of Aesop, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, the most enchanting and fantastic is undoubtedly the Holme refectory. Transported from the drudgery of central Sydney, the venue is being specially reopened for this occasion, converted to a Germanic wood and princely ball, liable for the losing of many an unwanted child, and the finding of gingerbread houses.

The evening includes drinks, canapés and entertainment from all four societies, as well as live music and an invariably successful after party (we have booked a secret venue that lies in the fantasy lands beyond the reaches of the drink controlling tyrants, Baird and O’Farrell).

Last year the event sold out, so book early. Tickets can be purchased online here: http://www.trybooking.com/ERBW, and will not be sold on the door.

_______________________________________________________

MAGNETIC is a dance performance event that looks at the capacity of our bodies to affect and be affected. The show aims to leave audiences considering the different ways that bodies can mean and to highlight the body as an event, as a happening. How is consciousness shaped by the push and pull of different forces. What draws us in? What repels us? What forces exert on us and forge us into the beings we are today?

MAGNETIC is an experiment. What happens when you bring together 12 young and talented choreographers of different styles, working only with the concept of 'MAGNETIC' to bind them? How do choreographers, dancers, audiences make links between disparate and conceptual representations of 'MAGNETIC'? The end result is a hybrid production of hip-hop, contemporary, bellydancing, ballet, Argentine tango, jazz, rumba, tap & JFH.

MAGNETIC is an outlet for creativity, inspiration, interpretation, potential. It is founded on the fact that no dance style or embodied expression is more tenable or deserving than another. That no grand narrative or storyline is more important than the one you imagine as you take in the show. But more than anything...

MAGNETIC is potential...

PERFORMING ARTS BALL 2013: THE BLITZ BALL

When the air-raid sirens wail most Londoners head for the shelters to wait out the night. But a select few, as fire rains from the sky, raise their glasses, unbowed and unbroken by the threat to their homeland. They fight the war with joy and laughter; eating, drinking, and dancing the night away, winning the battle for hearts and minds.

From London's high society to military personnel, domestic and international, the guests can be anyone. Dressed to the nines, and with the the refurbished nightclub-bunker fully stocked, Britain's finest musicians and performers are invited to entertain.

You are invited to the Blitz Ball.

Keep calm and party on.

For the first time ever in 2013, MADSOC will be part of interuniversity dance camp LE'GO! Packed with workshops, performances and social events, LE'GO will take place over the first three days of the Easter break. With dance societies from UTS, UNSW, UWS and Macquarie in attendance (not to mention our bro' from another mo', Soulxpress), this is an event not to be missed!

LE'GO welcomes dancers of all styles and levels, with one of its main events this year being inspired by the Vegas Group Rounds in So You Think You Can Dance. We'll be throwing five dancers from different styles together, giving them a short piece of music (it could be Usher...or Tchaikovsky! GASP) and asking them to come up with a fun and entertaining dance piece. (Don't worry, it's not as intimidating as it sounds, and the main thing is to have fun and make friends!)

So what are you waiting for? We're looking for anywhere between 10-20 happy campers from MADSOC to join us on our LE'GO adventure. Keep an eye on this page for more information and updates!

The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde

“I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.”

Jack Worthing created the identity of his fictional brother Ernest in order to escape his own mundane life and woo the woman of his dreams. Now that he may finally have her, he has decided to confess his true identity and kill off his ‘brother’ for good. It’s the perfect plan. That is, until fellow bachelor Algernon decides to show up at his country estate, also claiming to be Mr Ernest Worthing.

Originally performed in 1895, Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People” is widely considered to be the ultimate comedy of manners, examining the triviality of social conventions and obligations against the backdrop of polite society.

Set in contemporary Sydney, Suzie Miller’s Caress/Ache is a collection of five stories exploring human connection through touch; a surgeon unable to stand physical contact with the living, a couple tearing each other apart as they try to survive infidelity, a flunked out uni student yearning for her place in the world, a mother fighting to embrace her son one last time.

Throughout the days and nights crashing in Tom’s man cave, all Nick wants is to get his wife back - but Tom longs for the good old days and will stop at nothing to keep the boys together.

Divorced Dads is an original one act play dedicated to Nick and Tom’s own divorced dads, Chris and Mike.

422,SUDSusyd,SUDS Auditions: Punk Rock,1,36,338,0,36,411,"Punk Rock, by Simon Stephens

Show Dates: 7–17 March 2018

Available Roles: Lilly Cahill (Female)

Following one of our wonderfully talented cast members being accepted into NIDA’s acting program next year, we are looking to re-cast the roll of Lilly!
Punk Rock delves into the lives of seven students, heading towards their final exams in a private school in Stockport. A piece which could easily be mistaken for an off-beat romcom in its earlier scenes, quickly transforms as we are drawn into the students’ lives. Intimate moments reveal their concerns, their tenderness, their vulnerabilities. 
But the group interactions become sharper and more tense with every scene, as the students bully each other, lash out at one another, stand by and watch, and ultimately, push back. As the pressure builds and the group disintegrates, one character snaps with devastating consequence. If you swore you never wanted to relive Year 12, you’re going to want to make an exception for this one.

First round auditions will be held on 27 and 28 December, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 30-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Friday 29 December, and consist of between one and two-and-a-half hours of duologue work with other members of the ensemble.

To prepare for your audition:
1. Prepare the “Lilly” monologue. We want to be able to have a huge play with your monologue in the brief audition time we have, so memorisation is strongly encouraged!

You can find the monologue here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vypwRXmhboNkZxSHhlcXFjQms/view?usp=sharing

2. Read the script. It’s the point of reference for our work in the audition and callback, and taking the time to read the whole text before auditioning will be invaluable.

It is an analogy to the ropes hangmen use, sin and the sinner may just be left hanging. It is an analogy to the ropes couple use…for the lack of better words…for sexy time but be careful not to be bound for life. This story starts with Kira nearly drowning to her death. Dominic who coincidentally happened to be nearby saves her life. In that moment, the duo, along with two other friends, further develop their bond, with each dealing with their own toxicity and demons. This play is heavily focused on dialogue and storytelling, and also, of course, emphasising hope and human’s resilience in the battle against adversity and mental illnesses.""

Show Dates: 14–17 February 2018
Roles: 2 male, 2 to 6 female

Caress/Ache throws us into the lives of ten very different people, all affected and linked by touch. But not just the skin on skin contact we immediately think of. They are touched by ideals. A poem. A political cause. The stories in this play are an attempt to follow the many threads of what it means to be ‘touched’. We get to deftly leap from a loud, heartbroken couple fighting and interrogating a case of infidelity, to a hilarious first day of working at a phone sex line. There is light and dark, joy and grief. The struggle for our characters to connect in this world of touch builds to a yearning crescendo and breaks through in a final embrace. Thank goodness for catharsis, am I right? 

First round auditions will run from November 12th – 24th, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 20-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Sunday 3rd of December.

What can you do to prepare for your audition?

1. Prepare one monologue from those attached. To get the most out of your audition, memorisation is highly encouraged. That way you can show us your brilliant acting chops without being encumbered by a piece of paper!

Monologues to choose from can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zxz1FLl4PaNaMl-CPHgZJTPsOCOodWVC 

2. Read the script. While Wikipedia does have a pretty good blurb, reading the script will give you a more detailed idea of what you’ll be in for. It will also give you an accurate and all-encompassing depiction of the characters in the play, and can help you work out which one you would be most interested to play. On top of that, we’d love to chat and hear some of the ideas you have about the script as a whole during your audition.

Two dishonest bachelors both assume the identity of the very fictional Ernest Worthing in order to escape their own lives but are forced to meet the consequences of their actions when they are ultimately discovered.

Originally performed in 1895 Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People” is widely considered as the ultimate comedy of manners, examining the triviality of social conventions and obligations against the backdrop of polite society.

428,SUDSusyd,SUDS AGM 2017,31,23,245,0,23,322,"Hey hey heeey!!! Join us for the democratic event of the year! That's right, baby, we're voting in the SUDS warriors of 2018. The SUDS Annual General Meeting (AGM) ensures the continued existence of the oldest continuous drama society in Australia...by making sure we have an executive team so the USU does not deregister us. 
First, the President, Secretary and Treasurer will give you SUDSy reports about the year that was. Then, we vote! Every SUDS member can run for any position, and we encourage anyone who loves the society to put their name forward. 

We will be posting longer descriptions of the roles in the lead up to the event, but here is a brief outline of the roles that will be voted in at the AGM: 

President 
Reasonably self-explanatory. You are basically Big Brother - run the society, you are its face and voice, everything in the society comes back to you and you will be the first point of contact. For everyone. It's spooky but cool. 

Vice-President
An extremely flexible portfolio but one that is no-less important. You deputise and support the President. You're a helping hand to every portfolio and, aside from the occasional desire to stage a coup, you're an excellent Robin to SUDS's Batman. 

Treasurer
Money money money money. You give money to people who've spent money on the society's behalf, you plan a budget and conduct an audit at the end of the year. Think Scrooge McDuck but more fun and friendly. 

Secretary
You are responsible for the administration of the society. You manage memberships, take minutes, read the constitution lots. Best part: You manage space and time, as SUDS own in house Dr Who.

Publicity Officers
Like that annoying Facebook friend who doesn't know when to quit, your role is to literally throw notifications at people until they are brainwashed into going to EVERYTHING SUDS does. You'll run our social media accounts: twitter, Facebook, The Wash, our website, and you'll get everyone excited about what's coming up in SUDS. 

Social Secretaries
Oh the places you'll go! You get to plan all the social events for the society, with big $$ from our generous overlords (USU). You'll meet new people, and make them feel comfortable within the society but don't be fooled! This role has loads of admin as well. Use this opportunity to grow your social circle...

Cellar Officers
You are the Cellar's Fix It Felix and Inspector Gadget. You wil manage the tech and tools, teach others how to use them. You will attend bump-ins and bump-outs. You'll ensure everything is tidy, clean and adheres to safety standards. Safety standards will be your new best friends. 

Archivist
You are basically SUDS's foxy librarian. You are responsible for archiving all material from present shows as well as digitising and maintaining our ever-growing archival collection. 

HOW TO RUN: 
1. First things first, get in touch with the person who currently holds the position you want - they know a thing or two. Figure out what the role entails and what you want to do with it. 
2. We will vote the positions in the order above. For any position, you will need to be nominated - which you can do yourself or have a friend nominate you.
3. In the order of nomination, you will get a chance to sell yourself to the membership with a kick-ass speech. 
If you are running for President or Vice-President, you get 5mins and individual question time. 
All other positions get 3mins to speak. We will then run question time for each position, instead of each candidate. 

If you have any questions, concerns, thoughts, queries, qualms, the 2017 exec would love to hear from you! Seriously.. like, talk to us. We live for this

A lonely motel somewhere in the Northern Territory. Deep into the night, six lost souls play out a small, distant tragedy of lovesickness and social breakdown – only it’s not the same night. A teenage boy from a nearby country town waits for a stranger. Pregnant Emma waits for her husband, a country cop, wasted after his best friend's wedding. Anni, a government youth worker accompanied by a withdrawn and violent fourteen year-old girl, waits for the dawn. As the night draws on, each of them becomes trapped in dark and dangerous territory, each of them searching for a way out. 

Come along to the final SUDS slot of the year, and (hopefully) the final SUDS slot in the Common Room; an Australian play exploring the deep wounds caused by and through love, and the broken relationships it leaves behind. Join us as we interrogate the role of authority in administering justice, and question who we trust to protect us from each other.

A play by Andrew Bovell

This is certainly a night to remember. Sitting in the pub on a Friday evening two men wait for a mutual friend, each with a very different idea on how the night is going to play out. On the next table over some co-workers are just trying to have a nice, normal night out. The night that follows could be described as anything but nice and normal.

After Dinner, written by Australian playwright Andrew Bovell is a beautiful and hilarious look into awkwardness, loneliness and the social world.

Two people meet on a quiet afternoon in Central Park. Their conversation starts a series of events that will lead to the death of the death of one, and forever scar the other. Edward Albee’s beautifully written account of the forgotten, broken people asks powerful questions about life and the worth of an individual. Told in real time, this play sets two people against each other in a raw, emotional struggle for survival.

SUDS Presents: Amédée or How to Get Rid of It
August 2nd-12th, 7.00pm
THE COMMON ROOM, HOLME BUILDING  

A comedy by Eugene Ionesco

“I can’t understand how we ever got into such a mess. It’s so unfair… And in a case like this… no-one to turn to for help and advice!...”

Amédée and Madeleine Buccinioni are a married couple who live in an apartment in Paris. They have not left this apartment for 15 years. Additionally… there is something unsettling in the next room. And its growing. 

Eugene Ionesco’s first full length, absurdist play deals with a decaying relationship haunted by past misdeeds and mistakes. Amédée, a playwright who has written only two lines of his play in 15 years and Madeleine, his disappointed and hardworking wife who is left to manage their increasingly dire situation. 

With an apartment that’s beginning to sprout mushrooms, ‘terrifying’ visits from the postman and something mysterious lurking in the next room, Amédée and Madeleine have created a world in their apartment which is strange and comical, yet at the same time immensely sad. Treated with characteristic wit, this tragic comedy goes deeper than just absurdity yet manages to touch the very heart of human relationships as we observe the severity of our actions and the danger of letting life pass you by…

“It beckoned to me, and I couldn't help but follow”

A series of disappeared persons line 100 years of Herald obituary sections. Despite the best efforts of the authorities, each search has proved fruitless.

As history begins to forget these lost souls, three social pariahs have come forward with a crazy theory they say links them all. So close to finding the answers and forever changing history, one of the group has mysteriously vanished; seemingly into thin air.

From the team behind the sold out immersive productions, ‘Weathervane’ and ‘a menagerie’, comes ‘In Two Circles’. Enter their world, be bold, and find your truth.

Hazelwood Jr. High
By Rob Urbinati

It’s 1989. Blue eyeshadow is in and hippies are out. Tiffany is so hot right now. Like something out of a John Hughes movie, six teenage girls traverse the halls of their high school.

See, there’s a new girl in town, Shanda. Amanda is totally in love with her. Melinda is pretty, popular and batshit crazy. Laurie Tuckett – she dropped out – is a psychopath. Hope is boy crazy and Toni can’t even get a date to homecoming.  

It’s just another day at Hazelwood Jr. High. But, as relationships bloom and people get dumped, a revenge plot is hatched. Things begin to spiral out of control. Open laughter moves from uncomfortable giggling to deep, dark silence.

It’s totally whacked out.

By Brad Fraser

Love and life are messy things — we get all tangled up as we look for connection and meaning in our existence. Things are complicated enough as it is, but add a serial killer into the mix and who knows what could happen…

Set in Edmonton, Alberta, the comedy-drama follows the lives of several sexually frustrated ‘thirty-somethings.’ Candy, who’s looking for the perfect man and true love; her homosexual roommate, David, who no longer believes love exists; Kane, a sexually confused teenager; Bernie, David’s troubled best friend; and Jerri, falling hopelessly in love with Candy. The otherworldly Benita, who overlooks the proceedings with a certain psychic knowledge. All of them try to learn the meaning of love — and all while a serial killer is terrorising the city, killing unidentified women…

Come viddy a real horrowshow that’ll knock you off yarblookos!

Translation: SUDS will be performing Anthony Burgess’s stage production of the novel (and Kubrick film) that was banned, glorified and idolised around the world: A Clockwork Orange. Tracking the story of 15 year old narrator, Alexander de Large, whose interests in sex, violence and Beethoven inevitably land him in prison, the administration of the controversial Ludovico technique begs the play’s overarching question: should humankind choose to be evil, or forced to be good?

Filled with delightful dark comedy and rife with references for true cinephiles and readers, come one, come all and view the cult classic adapted by SUDS.

“You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham. You are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind.”

Patrick Hamilton’s ‘Gaslight,’ written in 1938, is a thriller set in Victorian London. The play explores the psychologically intense and disturbing relationship between the newly married Manninghams. As the play progresses, we see the extent of this emotional manipulation as Bella Manningham, with the help of private investigator Kate Rough, uncovers her husband’s dark secret and attempts to take him down.

Did you miss out on seeing 'Gaslight?' Due to how quickly tickets sold out, 'Gaslight' will be performing an encore on the evening of Thursday 23rd March! A limited number of tickets will be released online at 1pm, Monday 20th March. The rest will be sold at the door, so be sure to come early and grab a ticket before they sell out for good.

Join us for a scintillating afternoon of performance on the sweeping lawns of the Quadrangle. Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” will be performed as never before. And, with any luck, as it will never be performed again! 

Follow the unfortunate journey of a motley cast and crew as they take on all the highs, lows and (often inevitable) disasters of student theatre. Watch them as things slide from bad to worse, forced to move from space to space, losing cast members and constantly running into less than cooperative characters along the way. But, as the age-old saying goes, the show must go on! Which in this case, means it must go on to the next performance space as soon as possible! 

SUDS’ “Walking with Woolf” will take you on an exciting (and manageable) journey around campus and will also feature performances from MUSE, SUSO and SURCAS. So come walk with us for a crash course in student theatre.

From Gillian: ""You want an abstract recipe for some vids involving me and some sexy interplay with food? All whilst I attempt to develop an interplay between identity, culture and consumerism within contemporary society? Yeh thought so... Its grotty, weird and feels like the furry sensation you get when you haven't brushed your teeth for a while. My mum doesn't like my films but yours does, what more can I say.""

There’s no way to describe this film without spoiling. It’s a short documentary, about 100 minutes, about parental relationships. There is a significant chance that this will be the festival favourite, and it’s an important palette cleanser after the film about robot cops.

Movie? STORIES WE TELL (2012) dir. Sarrah Polley.

You said the films were too old, let’s get topical!

We’ll be serving, depending on the weather, HOT CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE (BYO IRISH); or ICY COLD RED BULLS.

RUN SHEET:

1AM: THE DEAD ZONE, dir. David Cronenberg. The film that launched the career of Christopher Walken, THE DEAD ZONE concerns a man suddenly able to see people’s futures by touching them. Incidental contact with a charismatic political candidate reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

3AM: THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP AS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, dir. 62,979,879 American People and, according to some, Breitbart, 4chan, and Senator Bernie Sanders. The ceremony that launches a new era in America concerns a country suddenly able to see their future by voting incorrectly. THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

tl;dr:

What time is this? The Inauguration starts around 3am, but to be safe we’ll be aiming for coverage from 2:30am. There will be a fun film shown immediately before.

This week: Paul Verhoeven’s 1987 film, ROBOCOP.

The city of Detroit is in financial ruin and is about to be privatised by Omni Consumer Products. The underfunded Detroit Police Department threatens to strike. A corrupt board of corporate fat cats argues over who has the best disruptive app replacement for cops.

Despite how it sounds (a film about a Robot Cop), the film introduced American audiences to Verhoeven’s dark, sometimes-absurd style of satire. It’s filled with fake ads, Reaganomics, and the bad guy is played by the Dad from That 70s Show.

Movie? Robocop (1987) dir. Paul Verhoeven.
Didn’t that come out last year? No please it is NOT the remake it is VERY different.
Why would an international corporation want to buy Detroit of all places? Because you can save money not giving your citizens water.

It’s the height of Summer and there’s no better way to spend a humid Sunday evening than with your friends at the pictures.

First up: Spike Lee’s 1989 opus “Do The Right Thing”. The film depicts rising tensions in a Brooklyn suburb during a heatwave and was criticised at release for “inciting black audiences to riot”. 

Really what it did was clarify Spike Lee’s developing artistic vision. It’s a kinetic film, interspersed with slice-of-life vignettes that create a vibrant sense of neighbourhood previously absent from Hollywood’s grim, gawky portrayals of the ghetto. 

It’s equal parts funny and tragic and is, above all else, entertaining.

We’ll be serving popcorn and choctops on a pay what you want platform, there will be no ticket price at the door. We would advise all viewers to bring snacks and drinks themselves. This isn’t Dendy, we won’t be searching your bags. Free popcorn for anyone who brings a pillow to sit on, but there will also be enough chairs/pillows/comfy jackets from the costume room for all. 

We’re constructing a projector screen. We’ve keyed the cellar’s speakers to surround sound. We’ve torrented a bluray.* This is Alana Cherry’s projector as you have never seen before. 

- Peter, Courtney, and Dom. 

tl;dr: 

Movie? Do The Right Thing (1989) dir. spike lee.
Is it good? Roger Ebert thought so.
Roger Ebert’s a pleb. That’s not a question but it also played Cannes to a standing ovation.
What’s Cannes? Now who’s the pleb?
Who’s asking the questions here? Me.

Food? Popcorn/Choctops.

This thought is getting some flavour as I learn more about climate change. Even the ground is dying. Neat. 
I’m trying to cope. I can’t seem to think of much else. It’s always at the back of my mind. This is my mind right: death climate change death my ex death ex sex isn’t as good when youre not in love climate change death he has my favourite pair of underwear recycling would inviting him to the show make him remember what we had and cry death. Woah. Downer!! Hahaha. ha. I’ll add some saucy spice and take some stabs at such beloved institutions as religion, monogamy and Batman. Also i’m trans. That’s a selling point (at usyd).

While they brag about their refurbished apartment, Vanek tries to be enthused. They gradually begin a verbal attack on Ferdinand, but, when he turns to leave, they beg him to stay, as they unveil that their latest project is him.

DOZENS OF COUSINS is twenty years in the future, placing Vanek back in the living room of Michael and Vera, shadowed by their maid Beda, for the same old games in a shiny new context: communism has died with a whimper and the Free World beckons with drugs, luxuries, and untold exotic wonders.

This double bill presents two of the infamous autobiographical Vanek Plays written by Vaclav Havel, recounting actual events from his life as a browbeaten artist, who would later bring about the fall of corrupt communism and establish the modern democracy that is the Czech Republic. They’re fast paced, funny, witty political farces.

How do we as creative people thrive and exist in a society which seems intent on telling us that what we have to contribute to society is useless bordering on irrelevant?

Do we kill ourselves?

Medicate legally or illegally?

Do we treat everything with a sheen of ironic pleasure, lulling ourselves in to a faint sense of blissful ignorance?

How do we navigate the murky waters of genuine heartfelt discovery that is constantly being probed and dismantled?

Maybe we should sit in the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY’S dankest hole nude peeling potatoes for 24ish hours where predominantly students of the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY can gawk at us, staring at our genitals and giggling at the hilarity of it all, trying to think up meaning. It has to mean something right? We have to mean something? Right? Is it all pointless? Does Anything Mean Anything?

Cellar Theatre, Sydney University

""The actual facts are so simple. I love you. You love me. You love Otto. I love Otto. Otto loves you. Otto loves me. There now! Start to unravel from there.""

‘Design For Living’ is Noel Coward’s 1931 comedy about a ménage-a-trois. Otto, Leo and Gilda love each other but can’t quite make their love work. From their bohemian life in Paris to the heights of their success in New York, we see these three characters try and navigate the difficult world of “love among the artists.”

This production aims to reveal the melancholic heart at the centre of Coward’s most controversial comedy.

The Book of Job is one of the most fraught texts of our culture. It is a book from the old testament. It is a book about why we all suffer. It's about why you think “oh, jeez, I thought stuff was meant to be good but now it's bad, damn.” 

Also portions of it dont make sense. Despite this, truly astonishing poetry remains, rendering the text painfully compelling. We turned it into a play. It features God. God is a big man in the sky. He is a big dude and he is extremely scary. He has a big beard and is very very strong. I like God but I'm not sure he likes me :(

The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare
7pm, 31 August and 1-2 September
5:30pm, 3rd September 
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

“Hath not a Jew eyes?” 

In Venice, Antonio borrows 3000 ducats from Shylock, risking a pound of flesh if he forfeits.

In Belmont, a wealthy heiress Portia can neither choose or refuse love, but must marry whoever solves her dead father’s puzzle. 

But plans to elope, ill luck at sea, and a culture of prejudice forces these disparate narratives together, drawing Portia and Shylock into a terminal conflict that threatens the peace and order in Venice.

This streamlined production of ""The Merchant of Venice"" will interrogate the assumptions that precede one of William Shakespeare’s most compelling and controversial plays.

Summer and Smoke, by Tennessee Williams
7pm, 10 – 13 and 17 – 20 August
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

""What you have here is not the anatomy of a beast, but a man.""

A Minister’s daughter’s beliefs are thrown into question when a romance blooms with a young off-the-rails doctor. As she strives for something beyond the tangible, something greater than taste or touch or sight, her life and the lives of those she loves are thrown into chaos.

Appropriated to urban Sydney circa 2016 and heavily scored with a mix of classical and electro-dubstep music, Summer & Smoke reinvents a masterpiece by one of the great American playwrights to question the value of conservatism to a modern audience.

“Fucking and shooting are the same thing.”

Berlin, 2nd June, 1967. A student protest turns violent, and a student is shot and killed. The next ten years become a cycle of escalating violence; bombings, state brutality, murder, and psychological warfare, ending in 1977 with a plane hijacking and a stand off between the State and the student terrorists. 

Black Hands/Dead Section follows the rise and fall of the infamous Baader Meinhof gang, and the personal and political consequences of fighting violence with violence.

“…Marvellously young and marvellously beautiful. Youth and beauty are the only things worth having in this world…”

Inspired by the words of a new acquaintance, the young Dorian Gray gazes upon his freshly-painted portrait and wishes that the image might grow old while he might remain young. To the detriment of all around him, his wish is granted. 

A new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ by Nadia Bracegirdle, 'Dorian' explores obsession, love, vice, and what it means to place aesthetic ideals above all else.  In this decadent and carefree world is an underbelly of shame, fear, blackmail, and violence, which begs the question: how far are we willing to go to maintain our ideals?

Written by Phillip Ridley 

This play calls itself “the story of you and your first great love”

Tender Napalm is a 2 hander involving a man and a woman exploring their relationship and their battles of love, compassion and grief.  Riding through waves of storytelling, fantasy and past memories they create armies against each other while deflecting the distance and pain growing in between them.  It studies the violence of love and association with hate and the bond created through grief.

Beat: (noun) the smallest unit of action in a scene; a shift in the action, thought, or emotion of the actor(s).

Beat: (noun) the basic unit of time in music, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level.

Beat is a show served in two parts, these parts playing consecutively over two weeks.

Part 1 explores silence as an essential element of drama and a by-product of human communication - does silence speak louder than words? How do humans communicate and miscommunicate? Does silence carry across culture?

Part 1 features:
Anja Bless (dir.), Ang Collins (dir.), Bianca Farmakis (dir.), Elijah Fink (dir.), Gabe Gregory, Bronwyn Hicks, Jack Kennare, Angela Lin (dir.), Maggie Liuzzi, Laura McInnes, Meg McLellan (dir.), Lauren McNaught, Elizabeth Milstead, Riley Nolan (dir.), Helena Parker, Max Peacock, Jean Pham, Issy Phillips (dir.), Jimmy Pucci (dir.), Tushar Prasad, Perri Roach (dir.), Michael Sun, Emma Webb, Anna Williamson, Jess Zlotnick (dir.), Noa Zulman

Part 2 is a cacophony of noise: boisterous, rude, fantastic. Noise and sound are inherent to everyday life - it exhausts and invigorates. 

Part 2 features:
Tamara Bailey, Robert Boddington (dir.), Georgia Britt (dir.), Ally Canas, Clare Cavanagh (dir.), Julia Dabrowski, Keshini De Mel, Gabby Florek (dir.), Hal Fowkes, Charlotte Friels, Madeleine Gandhi, Sarah Graham (dir.), Jane Hughes (dir.), Tracy Leung, Harriet Lugsdin (act/dir.), Alex McHugh, Elizabeth Milstead (dir.), Ryan Naylor, Julia Robertson (dir.), Ellie Rogers (dir.), Caitlyn Sinclair, Michael Sun (dir.), Adam Waldman (dir.), Shae Watkins

What is language but a construct? What is communication but a facilitator of relationships?

JE NE SAIS QUOI is an original bilingual play by Alana Cherry and Victoria Zerbst that traverses planes of time and space to crystallise answers to these questions. Art and philosophy intersect, lovers collide, words are exchanged, misshapen, and lost in this intellectual romp across language and culture. 

At its crux, it is a glimpse into the heart of human connections through the lives of six – a French couple, an Australian couple, and a pair of writers. But throw in a sarcastic waiter, a live band, a cabaret number, and a mime, and suddenly every character questions the nature of conversation and human interaction. Can their connections transcend our constructed barriers of communication? Qu’est-ce que c’est, l’amour?

Over the course of a single day, six characters’ lives are meshed and moulded, as they flirt with notions of romance, music, and Capital A Art.

In a quiet country town, long ago, there lived a girl who wasn’t happy. Lady is stuck, labelled, bored. Washing clothes and leering men, marriage, children, routine – a life her mother accepts, her friend awaits. A life she must escape. 

Bathed in blood our heroine drowns, drifts and surfaces, desperate to emerge, rise from the depths of her nothing life and stand on her own feet. She won’t take less than greatness. With magic and lies she’ll get what she wants. If the sacrifices she makes on the way throw nature out of joint Lady only cares that it’s known the chaos was her doing. 

Witness the rise of a great woman who did much more than stand behind a great man. 

Lady is an original play, workshopped by cast, writer and director to be presented on stage for the first time as the opening show of SUDS' 2016 season.

Girl doesn’t really want to put a label on anything, but figures this might be the chance to finally have something worth putting a label on. 

But there’s something wrong with this romantic comedy, and it isn't just the hacky writing and the two dimensional female lead and the fact that these tropes are force-fed and familiar.  

Between ex-girlfriends and loud sisters and sharks with machine guns, Joe and Sierra manage to find something they can call their own romance. After all, Sierra really is Joe’s dream girl. It’s almost as if she was made for him. 

Manic Pixie Dream World is a new play exploring the stereotypes and tropes of the romantic comedy and the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

Drottingham exists stagnant, as it has for centuries - that is, until Prof. Northumberland is pronounced dead. He leaves behind a valuable piece of land, but no lawful heir to make claim to it. According to the traditions of the town, ownership of the land is to be determined by seven noble townsfolk, who run and administer its essential industries.

But Drottingham has a secret. It is home to a pair of werewolves, hidden under the guise of two of these townsfolk. These two werewolves will be present in the town meeting, trying to disguise themselves as villagers, and they will not rest until the town is theirs.

But who can stop them?

Through a series of rounds, characters will be eliminated from the show, voted off by the audience. Working for the good of the town, YOU will try to spot the two individuals who you believe to be the werewolves, taking note of sly looks, shifty accusations and general wolf-like behaviour. Neither the audience, nor the actors will know who the two werewolves are. Each night the characters will draw a card out of a hat and play that role for the rest of the show.

‘Werewolves’ is an interactive, improvised, “choose-your-own-adventure,” murder mystery. Can you spot the werewolves before it’s too late?

""O hell, to choose love by another's eyes!”

Helios. Demetrius. Hermia. Lysander.

Four lovers flee into the forest, away from their parents and a society that says they can't be together. As bonds are broken, family and friendship are shown to be as flawed as the standards they are built on. Family can be escaped, can values?

“This same progeny of evils comes from our dissension.”

Puck. Titania. Oberon. Theseus. Hippolyta. Egeus.

In a constant fight for dominance, games are played with the mortals and forest as pawns. Power can be won, but is it worth it when you tear apart those beneath you?

“Never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it.”

Bottom. Quince. Flute. Snout. Snug. Starveling.

A patch of rude mechanicals come together to rehearse a play, but the deeper they delve into the forest, the harder this proves. Can you remain true in world that has forgotten how to understand you? 

As these narratives interweave, the ability for us to engage; with ourself, with others, and with the values of others, is called into question. Why do we struggle to understand the world beyond ourself? Is this why we’re homophobic or selfish? Do we allow ourselves to treat it as a dream?

The magic of theatre in Shakespeare’s Midsummer captivates the imagination of its audiences; infinitely complex yet poetically simple, the play seeks out a world attainably beautiful. A Midsummer Night's Dream will leave its audiences from all walks of life with the elusive question of how we understand theatre, and how we understand each other— If you engage that is, it could just be a dream.

'Culture is something I absolutely piss on.'

Serge buys an expensive contemporary painting. Marc can’t believe it. Yvan does his best. It’s plain white. Three close friends have it out in a Parisian apartment over the canvas on the wall. Much that has remained unspoken throughout their years together is lured to the surface, and the seemingly harmless painting threatens to be what shatters their friendships.

It’s been 125 years of small budgets and big ideas, cheap wine and rich theatre, drama and politics on stage and off, old stories and new works, short rehearsal periods and long tech runs, dingy venues and bright talents, and everything in between that has made the Sydney University Dramatic Society and its particular brand of student theatre as vibrant, addictive and resonant as it remains today.

In 2015, our 126th year, the Sydney University Dramatic Society will be celebrating and looking back on 125 years of student theatre as we return to the Great Hall to restage one of the society’s first productions, Aeschylus’ Agamemnon.

Join us to celebrate this extraordinary milestone, and the wonderful history of SUDS. 

--------------------------

Agamemnon returns from war with a prophetess in tow. He did terrible things when he was away. His wife Klytaimestra knows. She will have her vengeance.

It is beautiful and it is terrible. It is wrong and it is so, so right.

Everything spirals out from this moment: one of the great stories of Western mythology, a feast of language and violent spectacle that climaxes in the rebirth of civilisation.
Before, there was the fall of the Titans, the fall of Thyestes, the Trojan War and the Odyssey. After, there will be the hunt of the Furies, the verdict of the gods, and the foundation of justice. At the heart of it all lies Agamemnon.

Better so, ever wondered what it’s like to be a part of Australia’s largest professionally focused student organisation? Apply now to become a subcommittee member for the Financial Management Association of Australia (FMAA)! 

The FMAA was established in 1990 to foster business connections and recognise the importance of networking. To this day, that same objective still echoes through the organisation, connecting students with our sponsors through various networking opportunities. 

Why the FMAA Subcommittee? 
Whether you’re a seasoned FMAA member or simply a student entering your first year of university, becoming a subcommittee member of the FMAA will provide you with endless opportunities and experiences. These range from helping the organisation at our keynote events, to maintaining close contact with executive members. In addition, you will be able to develop your teamwork, communication and organisational skills. Such skills are highly sought after by employers in the corporate world. Having said all of this, please bear in mind that such a role is not simply a walk in the park. With every opportunity comes a lot of responsibility, and as such, this is by no means an easy role. 

Recruitment Process 
We will be holding a number of coffee meet-ups with applicants throughout the first few weeks of the new semester. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of your character and motivations for joining the FMAA. Finally, we will be holding interviews with applicants in the middle of the semester.


UPDATE: Applications for the 2017 FMAA subcommittee have officially opened! Please apply by filling out this form: https://form.jotform.co/70550834005852
The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on Friday 7 April. Please note that this form is separate from the Mailing List you may have previously filled out, so if you do not submit this new form we unfortunately will not receive your application. 

We have enjoyed meeting everyone who has come to postering and our coffee meet ups over the past few weeks! Please remember that although applications have officially opened, postering and coffee meet ups will continue next week, and execs will continue to take attendance of those who are present. Additionally, please note that the FMAA places a strong emphasis on commitment and cohesiveness with the team, both of which are primarily displayed through attendance at postering and interaction with executives. If as an applicant you don't attend postering or coffee meet ups you will unfortunately be at a disadvantage in seeking to gain a place on the subcommittee, and are unlikely to be granted an interview if you have never attended one of these sessions.   

The date for recruitment interviews has been tentatively set for the evening of Monday 10 April, so please attempt to keep this free and comment any availabilities you may have in the provided space in the form.

Another key feature of this event will be the two Guest Speakers who will be sharing their own insights and extensive knowledge of the industry. 

Following the panel discussion, there will be an open networking session where students will have the opportunity to engage closely with sponsor representatives and ask more specific questions tailored to their interests.

Price of your ticket obviously includes entry into the rest of The Ivy to party into the morning, because Tomorrow Never Dies.

Historically, our ball has been both better AND cheaper than all the other faculties', and this year is no exception.

The pricing is:

Member: $85
Access: $95

Please note that this event is 18+, and your ID will be required to get into the Ivy.

This year's ball is being sponsored by our friends and colleagues at Susquehanna International Group (SIG), and we're excited to hear briefly from one of their representatives during our event. You can check out opportunities with SIG here: https://sig.com/

It'll cost you $5 to get in on gameplay. That should cover all of us for every game.
We'll start with tables of 10. When you get slapped, instead of stacking cups, you'll hold on to the empty one you just drank. Once the game ends, the five people with the fewest cups will progress to the next round.
***If you get stuck in the cage, and get slapped 3 times in a row, you are knocked out***
All the rules of the game can be hard to explain, so your friendly SUEUA exec will be making an instructional video in the next day or so. Fair warning, most of us will be playing on the day. Come at me.

608,SU.Engineers,SUEUA Sees USYD Revue,10,29,10,0,29,78,"If you're new to uni, or if you've been living under a rock during your time here, you might not be aware of the faculty and identity revues that are run every year. Engineering has a proud history as the oldest (so I'm told) continuously running (deregistration doesn't matter so long as the show goes on) faculty revue at USYD. In recent history, this has been largely due to the inspiring leadership of our 2016 director, Mattie Longfield!

Each year, the best acts and sketches are selected from the faculty and identity revues, provided with a solid injection of cash, and combined together to make one super revue! Engo revue made the cut with one of our sketches this year, and Mattie has been attending rehearsal every Thursday (yes, instead of partying) to do us proud. 

To support our friend, and as an excellent excuse to enjoy a drop or two on a thursday night, we'll be attending the revue, preceded by some cheeeeap drinks outside PNR. Pick up tickets here: https://www.seymourcentre.com/events/event/2017-sydney-uni-revue/ Obviously, SUEUA does not recommend taking more drinks into the Seymour Centre for during the show, or heckling the performers - these behaviours would certainly be frowned upon.

tl;dr: 
What - USYD Revue, starring our lovely friend Mattie
Where - Seymour Centre, after drinks at PNR
When - Thursday evening; drinks from 5pm
How much - $15 for a ticket to revue, $2 for a drink beforehand

611,SU.Engineers,Beer 'n' Bangers 2017: Into the Woods,342,345,484,0,345,1516,"Once upon a time there was a party that the engineers held under the immortal bronze flesh statue of Peter Nicol Russell. Each year a new cohort of degenerates would partake in increasingly daring feats under the orange glow of the King. Then, everything changed when the Seymour drywall puncher attacked. We’ve had a few years of different locations, and according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way Beer ’n’ Bangers should be allowed to be held at PNR again. But whispers have trickled down the grapevine of PNR - whispers of an event so off the rails not even an extremely high coefficient of friction could keep this hype-train on track. It’s the night that’s going to be litter than lit and turnter than Joey Oregano at the Newtown hotel.

It’s Beer ’n’ Bangers 2017: Into the Woods.

Welcome to Engineering’s biggest sausage fest of the year, not to mention the all you can eat BBQ. We’re taking the event back to its roots, its rightful home in PNR courtyard. This year’s theme is Into the Woods, which, like Rule Zero, is open to interpretation. So we want to see your sauciest Cinderellas and raciest Rumpelstiltskins in a wild night that will leave you more cooked than Hansel and Gretel in the witches oven.

What: Beer ’n' Bangers: Into the Woods
Where: PNR Courtyard, baby. We back!
When: Thursday 13th of April, 6:30 pm
How much: 35/Early Bird

621,SU.Engineers,Roaring 20s - Engineering Ball 2016,334,272,291,0,272,1169,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

The SUEUA executive is proud to present our biggest and favourite event of the year: Engineering Ball! Faculty balls are your chance to dress up and let loose with all your friends, be a little fancy, and ignore all the consequences: because it's right before midsem!

This year Engineering will be returning to the Ivy Ballroom, for a 3 course meal, unlimited drinks and live music. The theme for this year is Roaring 20s! Get dressed up and ready to stay a little more classy than we might be used to. Protest the prohibition, and learn how to dance without grinding (only for the first part of the night, don't worry), all while eating and drinking in absolute style and the greatest company. Price of your ticket obviously includes entry into the rest of The Ivy to party into the morning after the Ball is over.

Historically, our ball has been both better AND cheaper than all the other faculties', and this year is no exception. This year, in the finest venue we've ever had the pleasure of occupying, we bring to you our most generous drinks package ever, an incredible menu (updates to come), and the JazzSoc 18-piece big band to soothe us through dinner and swing us into the afterparty. The pricing is:
Member: $85
Access: $95
Non-access: $105

Tickets will be sold this Friday at midday. Engineering Ball has a tendency to sell out on the first day, with lines known to stretch around PNR. Make sure to get in early to ensure you get a ticket!

Please note that this event is 18+, and your ID will be required to get into the Ivy.

This year's ball is being sponsored by our friends and colleagues at Accenture, and we're excited to hear briefly from one of their representatives during our event. You can check out opportunities with accenture here: https://www.accenture.com/au-en/careers/graduate-home

My lecturer used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Scientists, Earth Tradies, Fire Team Engineers, and Air Head Artists. But that all changed when the Fire Team attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four disiplines. Only he could stop the ruthless fire Engineers. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Team is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my demonstator and the men of my lab journeyed to the Earth Tradies to help fight against the Fire Team, leaving me and my partner to look after the Lab. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Heads, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.""

SUMO, MUGS and SparkSoc are proud to present this year; the inaugural Engineering Industry Dinner. Bringing together the largest collection of industry representatives for engineers of all disciplines; the 7th April will herald your biggest chance this year to network with the bastions of the industry.

With companies such as Microsoft, Google, Schneider, Ausgrid and over 40 more; the Holme Refectory will be the site of a network opportunity impossible to miss. The range of companies covers mostly areas in Electrical, Software, Automation, Mechanical and Consultancy; but due to the vast expanse of disciplines that all these companies cover, all degrees can find companies suited to themselves here.

Tonight will be a night of networking. So it’s highly suggested that in between the unlimited canapes and drinks that you take this valuable time to engage with all the industry guests present. Find out how their companies deal with graduates, what work would you be apart of, do they offer internships? Think of questions before the night and seek out those that can help you answer them. Make sure you research companies beforehand, it’ll be no good asking your Mechanical Engineering questions to Google.

Tickets will be sold from Week 1 onwards by SUMO, MUGS and SparkSoc outside of PNR, watch this event for information on the time we are present. There are limited spots and it’d be a waste of such a golden opportunity to miss a ticket because you thought you could just buy one at the last minute.

Why should the Olympics happen only every four years I hear you ask? The spectacle, the excitement, the drug scandals and the accusations of bankrupting the city only so a bunch of people can run around in circles wearing tight shorts.
At SUEUA, we’re going to do our part to keep up a more regular Olympic tradition with an appropriately engineering twist.

Thursday 30th May (week 12) head on down to the Engo lawns at 1PM and for just $10 you can get unlimited drinks, food, delightful red cups you can shake a medal at, as well as registering for competing in a variety of carefully selected beverage related superiority trials. 
Such tests of strength include beer pong, flip cup, battle shots, and more! (if you have suggestions feel free to make them and we'll decide if they are worthy)

And of course, no doubt we’ll be kicking on to the Royal to award our Gold Medalists around 5PM.

These are 3 hour certified football courses that are fully practical and encourage you to develop teaching practices that are based on FUN. The emphasis is on natural development i.e. learning by PLAYING football. No coaching but organising FUN football exercises is the key to helping players build a love for the game. Another highlight of the course is that the coaches are exposed to basic rules of the game as well as tips and hints on building a football culture in a completely practical setting.
This qualification will look great on your portfolio, but it also demonstrates that you have a commitment to advance yourself and your knowledge as a professional.

In case you missed it, last year’s Purple Sneakers Tenth Birthday celebration was one of the events of Vivid Sydney 2016. Those who were there will remember a line stretching around the block all night, hundreds of punters, nearly 30 acts over three stages, and more good vibes than we could have ever hoped for! 
 
The event featured the two things that matter most to Purple Sneakers: new emerging club music, and the Sydney music community. And as such the lineup we presented included some of our favourite emerging artists (incl. Moonbase, MEZKO, World Champion, Lastlings & more), as well as some of our favourite Sydney music community friends like Astral People, Linda Marigliano, Pilerats, Motorik, Stoney Roads, Andy Garvey, Sidechains, UNDR Ctrl, Luen Jacobs and many more. 
 
So, it made sense to do it all again this year as we blow out an extra candle on the birthday cake on Saturday 17th of June!  
 
For this year’s event, we’ve continued to carefully curate a lineup of exciting up-and-comers that we have supported on the blog and have loved to see grow over the past 12 months. The live stage will feature the internet hip hop poetry of Kimchi Princi; the forward-thinking production of Ninajirachi, the upbeat pop of Gussy; the serene sounds of OKBadlands, the futuristic sounds of Sortagoth, and the captivating electronica of Willaris. K. 
It wouldn’t be a Purple Sneakers party without a few community friends in the mix though, would it? Joining our live room will be two other stages just like last year - this year playing host to collectives and Sydney legends like Bad Deep, Fling Fling, Heaps Gay DJs, Kali Picnic, LOW TON, Matka, Mowgli May, Sandro Dallarmi, Sidehustle, SURG, Trench Records, Volumes, and of course Purple Sneakers DJs, as well as a very special DJ set from Christopher Port. 
 
Held at our spiritual home of The Lord Gladstone in Chippendale from 5pm to 3am, this year’s event will again be free entry, so we recommend you come down early as entry will be first in, first served.  
 
Purple Sneakers Eleventh Birthday is presented by world renowned cultural institution Vivid Sydney, Young Henry’s, and Sydney’s FBi Radio, who recently invited Purple Sneakers to broadcast on the main station, after presenting a show for 3 years on electronic music focused sister digital station FBi Click. 
 
So join Purple Sneakers as we celebrate another birthday as a tribute to all that we’ve done over the past year as a music community, a blog, a radio show, and so much more. 
 
Full lineup and details below. See you there!

THIS IS NEXT WEDNESDAY THE 12TH.

Our two presenters are Chris Taylor (of Chaser fame) and Michael Bradley (Managing Partner of Marque Lawyers).

Chris Taylor needs no introduction, but it's worth recalling the fact that as a Triple J presenter he promised to do a nudie run at Big Day Out if the Media Watch theme song was voted into the Hottest 100 (it did, and he did).

Michael Bradley's most recent high-profile case was the Dallas Buyers Club decision that made national headlines earlier this year. He has also represented Sony and Penelope Cruz. Bradley is almost as famous for his office eccentricities, which include having law students apply for clerkships by making a diorama, and giving all his staff $400 to spend on a pair of shoes.

We will be covering:
- Tech: how to use the MECO studio
- Content: how to make good radio
- Legal: defamation and media law in a community radio context

It is ESSENTIAL that you or your co-host attends training if you intend to have a show this semester. This goes for people who had a show last semester. Pizza and drinks at Courtyard are included in the price!

It's taken a little while but we've finally got our Semester 1 training date confirmed. 

This is THE single most important SURG FM event of the semester in terms of your future broadcasting career. We'll be training you up so you can not only propose shows to us but actually put them on! The night will go for approximately 3.5hrs and cover everything you need to know.

On the content side we have Chris North (comedian, announcer from Merrick and the Highway Patrol on Triple M), Annamarie Reyes (Volunteer and Training Coordinator 2SER, Executive Producer of On the Money and Radio Atticus 2SER, former ABC and SBS foreign correspondent) and a mystery music show guest. They'll be chatting to you about the areas of radio they work in and what sort of content you might want to put on your show. You'll also get a chance to break into smaller groups with each presenter to chat more specifically. 

On the production side we have Dominic Santangelo (MECO2601 Radio Broadcasting coordinator/lecturer, former Eastside FM drive host, musician) and Jacob Craig (Audio Media Officer for the Digital Media Unit, sound engineer, the guy on everybody's speed dial). Jacob will be showing you the ropes in the studio, teaching you guys how to not break the equipment and actually make your show sound good. Dom will be going through how to put together a radio show - preparation, organisation, content sourcing, last minute tips etc.

We'll be providing dinner so don't worry about that and I'm sure afterward there'll be enthusiasm for a post training beverage at The F'Lodge or similar. 

Also, this is a great opportunity to meet other keen broadcasters. If you don't have a show idea yet or don't know anybody else interested in SURG never fear, there WILL be somebody here for you! (gosh it sounds like a dating service, speaking of which...loljks)

Member: $5

Non member without Access: $16

On the back of appearances on SURG FM and Beat the System, Sean Ryan will be providing some laidback tunes to start the night off. After that we’ll be giving out awards to our best and brightest broadcasters. Categories will be announced closer to the date. Then DJ Floozy, the loosest DJ this side of Kentuckyshire, will be spinning beats until we’ve bled the bar dry.

Registration fee is $15 to help cover field hire etc. You will be emailed payment details with confirmation of your registration.

This is a tournament for USyd players but we're trying to be fairly inclusive still. Therefore, to be eligibile to play, you must fill one of the following criteria: 
(1) Are a current member or have been a member of Sydney University Quidditch Society 
(2) Have been on the roster of / have played for a USyd Team
(3) Have been/are in one of the USyd Teams groups (""201X USU Quidditch Team(s)"")

Our field booking is from 10am to 6pm, we intend to play some kind of round robin/double round robin format with finals, depending on the number of teams. Parking is available at the field, which is nearish Lindfield station, on the North Shore line. 

Pairs of Old and Current player co-captains will be chosen to choose teams in a draft (exact format yet to be determined but some kind of blind auction probably - some restrictions may be placed to promote roughtly even numbers of new/old players on teams, and roughly even numbers between teams). If you are interested in captaining (plz), you should indicate so on the form. 

We will also play an OldSyd vs NewSyd game at some point in the day, for banter. This will possibly involve a split of 2012-14 players vs 2015-17 players, or more probably a 50/50 split of players based on when they started playing, so that the NewSyd team doesn't blow out in numbers. May also be OldSyd vs CurrentSyd, depending on how the numbers work out/what will make for a more interesting game. 

We'll also be doing a BBQ lunch on the day (vego/vegan/healthy options available too). 

It should be a great chill day to catch up, have some fun, celebrate the long weekend, and play some quidditch - get hyped :D

Professor Wood is a pioneer in burns research and plastic surgery, particularly in the development of ‘Spray on Skin’. She is well known for continuously campaigning for burns medicine and through her ability to coordinate major medical response operations to worldwide traumatic events involving the treatment of burns victims such as the Bali bombings in 2002. Professor Wood was named a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2003, and named Australian of the year in 2005 for her tireless contributions to Medicine in the fields of Burns research. She is also an ‘Australian National Living Treasure’. 

Now in its 59th year, the Lambie Dew Oration is an annual public event held in honour of Professors Charles Lambie and Harold Dew, the first Bosch Chairs of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Sydney. It is an opportunity for the Sydney University Medical Society (SUMS) to invite a speaker who has made a major impact in health to address an audience in the formal surroundings of the Great Hall and represents one of the key scholarly events organised by SUMS.

6:00 pm: Refreshments
6:30-6:40: Talks from sponsors Pulse by BOQ Specialist and Medical Indemnity Protection Society - MIPS
6.40 - 7.00: Overview of the two years, what each term is, core blocks vs specialty blocks

8.05 - 8.20: What is a long case? How do they work? How do you practice? The manilla folder method
8:20 - 8:30 pm - Talks from NAMSA's Steven Campbell, specifically for international students

Our speakers will be:

KIERAN MUIR - STREAM 2/3 - ORANGE/SAN
Kieran hails from New Zealand originally but has gone under the cover for many years except when certain words sneak through. Spent the first two years at College, helped out on MedCamp in 2nd year and went out West for 3rd year to Orange. Spent his elective in South Africa, Nepal and New Zealand. Was involved with Convention during 4th Year and thinks he knows how to master the attendance and sign-off system quite well now. Kieran will be giving an overview to Stage 3 and discussing long case technique and the infamous manilla folder technique. 

EMMA SHEAVES - STREAM 3 - NORTHERN
Emma was previously a physiotherapist and has an avid interest in rural health, primary care (general practice and emergency medicine). Constantly at the top of the year for assessments and balances that with work and a number of other interests. Her stage 3 Core Terms were neurology/endocrinology (med 3), general surgery/orthopaedics (Lismore), critical care (RNSH), general practice /cardiology (med 4). She’ll be coming along to discuss stage 3 assessments, tips on study methods, exam information, and a general overview of stream 3. 

EMMA CUMMING - STREAM 4 - NEPEAN
Emma went to Lismore for year 3 and so is now an expert in shark attacks, Nimbin alterative medicine and whale watching. Emma will be discussing a typical week and ‘Day in the life of a Stage 3’ and her strategies on how to maintain the all important work/life balance. She’ll also be touching on where to live, study tips, organising a useful study group, endless podcasts, electives, MD project and many, many more topcis. 

SLAV NIKOLIC - STREAM 3 - WESTMEAD
Before med school Slav studied Exercise and Sports Science and then Physiotherapy, both at Sydney Uni (Cumberland Campus). Clearly a sucker for punishment, he followed the two degrees with Medicine. He has worked as a Physio at Westmead Hospital for 6 years and during med school has continued to work part time as a Physio on weekends. Slav is married and has two adorable children. Luka aged 4 years and Rafael aged 5 months (barrier exams with a 5-month-old…). Slav will be discussing a work/life/kid balance during Med School as well as some sage tips for the year. 

ERICA DANIELETTO - STREAM 3 - CONCORD
Erica hails from the least involved clinical school (Concord) and her med philosophy of flying under the radar means she also answers to Erin and Emma, so that will make remembering names on transition night even easier! Coming from a non-science background she can't tell you much about med, so instead she'll be talking about how awesome stream 3 is, being a secretarial mastermind, and bringing home the bacon. Her talk will cover how to be super organised with forms and other modules (eg. PPD, PopMed, Indigenous health, ophthal logbook) and working part-time during stage 3.

Thank you to our speakers for taking the time out to talk to us, and please come armed with all the questions you ever wanted to ask about Stage 3!

As part of the results, 15% of students reported currently suffering from a mental illness diagnosed by a psychiatrist and 19% have been diagnosed in the past. 

51% of students also reported having seen a professional for mental health issues in the past. 

What does this mean? Having a mental health issue doesn’t mean you’re more vulnerable or alone, and possessing resilience is only a small part of the solution in a difficult and competitive culture and working environment.

We know there’s much more to change and raising awareness is only the beginning, but we’re proud to present SUMS’ first ever Blue Party, an initiative started by AMSA Mental Health. All four years and external guests are invited, with activities, free food on the night, and most importantly, all profits going towards BeyondBlue.

___

We know that every day, medical students and trainees are put under a lot of pressure, whether it’s keeping up with classes and studying for exams or putting in long, demanding hours at hospital. This is on top of other pressures we may need to balance like part-time work and finances, relationships, family and more. However, looking after our own mental health and wellbeing is just as important as our physical wellbeing or the wellbeing of patients.

SUMS hopes that in this month of May, we can place a greater focus on increasing the dialogue surrounding mental health, to be able to reach out to our peers, feel encouraged to seek help and support if we need, and to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness.

Please be on the lookout for educational and fun events in May which will be announced on this page!

As medical students, we see firsthand the impact that leukaemias, lymphomas and myelomas can have on people’s lives. Though shaving or colouring hair may be temporary, the money raised and the impact it can have in improving someone’s life is not. That is why SUMS is proud to announce we will again be hosting a World’s Greatest Shave event at the Grandstand this year. The money raised for the Leukaemia Foundation will provide direct support to people living with blood cancers or help fund vital research as we get closer to becoming fully fledged doctors! 

In the lead up to the day, make sure to show your support and donate, and on the night, watch as your fellow medical students shave, colour or wax their hair for a great cause. You can also participate in our raffle on the night for a chance to win some great prizes as well. Or better yet, get involved and simply sign up at tinyurl.com/SUMSshaves to start your own journey! There will be a $100 voucher kindly donated by the Grandstand for the student who raises the most money.

A big thank you to our generous sponsors:
- The Grandstand Sydney Uni for the venue and gift voucher
- Noddys on King Hairdressers for donating their time to do the shaves and raffle vouchers

We are delighted to announce that the speaker for the 57th Lambie Dew Oration is Professor Fran Baum, Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor of Public Health and one of Australia's leading researchers on the social and economic determinants of health. 

Professor Baum will present an Oration to address the changing face of health equity as we move into an increasingly technological age of medicine with an increasing emphasis on personalised care. Challenges of balancing advances in medical care with equality of outcomes are already upon us, and likely to become more dramatic as new technology is developed. Professor Baum will challenge us to consider these issues head on, and consider the role of population health and medical professionals in promoting and advocating for health equity.

We look forward to having Professor Baum deliver a challenging and surely unforgettable Oration.

Free food carts (courtesy of BOQ Specialist), Red Bull and Djs have all been confirmed for the event.

They might be acting a bit differently -  seem to have a lot on their plate, missing class or simply don't seem themselves. Don’t ignore those signs - but instead take some time to start a conversation and ask “Are you OK?”

 R U OK? Day is a national day of action and dedicated to reminding people to regularly check in with family and friends. R U OK? Day is organised by The R U OK? Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to encouraging all people to regularly and meaningfully ask 'Are you ok?' to support those struggling with life.

The aim of the SUMS RUOK? day is to foster an environment where medical students are looking out for each other and feel prepared and comfortable enough to start up a conversation.The RUOK organisation has put together some practical tips on how to start a conversation with someone who you think is struggling:

In light of this, and as part of the Health & Wellbeing Program run by SUMS, we would like to invite you to our Inaugural Mental Health Forum. This is an opportunity to raise the issues involved with coping with, and talking about, mental health, in a safe and meaningful manner.

Four medical students in the Sydney Medical Program have kindly and bravely offered to share their experiences with us - in order to get a better sense of how one deals with these issues, and the kind of support services available whilst at university. This will be a safe space for discussion, and we request respect and discretion at all times - attendees are encouraged to ask questions of our speakers, and offer their own experiences if they would like to.

Although unsurprising given the lack of support the university has given the arts, this is also a censorship of our queerness, our identities, and our love. 

The point of this work, and all the works in the tunnel, was to provide Queer and LGBT+ awareness. Even more so it was about visibility of our bodies and our experiences. The erasure of Sam’s work speaks volumes to the level of acceptance around our LGBT+ identities. We tried to create a Queer space to last for FIVE days, and on the SECOND day it gets taken down because some old walnut clutched their pearls a little too vigorously. 

To them I say: 

Dear Walnut(s), consider your outrage: you erased a cartoon of love and equality. You censored a scene embracing of body and gender diversity. The fact that a cartoon of queer love could be deemed offensive to the point of censorship is so typical of our political state at the moment, that I have to laugh. Because it’s laugh or cry. I hope your knee jerk reaction of 'disgust' over our Queer love-in leaves you sleepless, because your actions speak hateful volumes to our community.

We meant nothing but good from this mural, this tunnel, and this space. Huge love to everyone positively involved and the rest of our community. You're all angels xxxx",2017-10-18T19:00:00+1100,University of Sydney,,,,,-33.888490000000004,151.18601,0.0,0.0

Then we will see you at our Consultancy Workshop run by EY Senior Consultant Joel Markoff, who is also now working as a General Manager of an exciting startup - Nexus Notes.

Joel knows consulting. After graduating he spent time with Grant Thornton's Recovery and Reorganisation team, and Deloitte's Strategy and Operations team, before beginning his career at EY in Performance and Improvement Advisory. He is one of EY's best internally-rated consultants, with experience in Education, Construction, Financial Services and Healthcare. He is eager to share the process he pursued in one of his engagements, to give us insight into how great consultants work. His advice will be invaluable to students who want to stand out in their applications to work in financial services.
 
He has paused his career at EY to work as General Manager of Nexus Notes, where he oversees a peer-to-peer marketplace used by ~1.5 million University students across Australia and New Zealand to sell and buy summary notes. It's a profitable startup turning over 150k in revenue per year, with 10K users already on the platform internationally. In 2015, it received seed funding through Australia's leading accelerator 'Startmate' which is backed by Blackbird Ventures. Later in 2015 the founders pitched on SharkTank AU. The venture was co-founded at Sydney University and Sydney remains the largest market to date. Students who have put effort into their notes can make easy money and also benefit from mentoring opportunities, job references and access to exclusive events and networking sessions with access to major commercial and legal firms.
 
Joel will be providing unique end to end insight into how a successful project is run at a consulting firm, by breaking down the process and highlighting the various stages of preparing a deliverable. He will also be highlighting how best to take advantage of great opportunities through Nexus Notes. The workshop will be interactive and audience participation is expected!

1049,Filmsoc.USyd,Halloween Double Feature: Ganja & Hess and Re-Animator,16,6,30,0,6,58,"For our final screening of the year, we’re showing a special Halloween themed double feature to wrap up 2017.

Screening first will be Bill Gunn’s 1973 film ‘Ganja & Hess’, an experimental horror take on a vampire tale that sinks deep beneath the skin. After being stabbed by his assistant with an ancient knife, notable anthropologist Dr Hess Green is transformed into an immortal being who is compelled to drink blood. Falling in love with his assistant’s wife, Ganja, he decides to bestow on her the gift of immortality. Named one of the best films of the decade at Cannes in 1973, ‘Ganja & Hess’ is an artistic and bizarre film that is full of symbolic imagery, abstract philosophical concepts and challenging ideas of sex, religion and cultural and racial identity. 

Next up will be Stuart Gordon’s ‘Re-Animator’, a classic of '80s horror which perfectly blends horror and humour to tell the story of a scientist who invents a solution which can bring living tissue back to life. Loosely based on H. P. Lovecraft's episodic novella Herbert West–Reanimator and inspired by Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, this outrageously gory and comedic film is sure to entertain.

Eschewing traditional notions of plot and drama, Reichardt opts instead for a naturalistic and understated approach, providing a deeply unsettling sense of uncertainty and desperation.

To the middle brother Charlie (Guy Pearce) he makes the following proposition: find and kill your older brother Arthur, or on Christmas day your younger brother will hang. The film launched the career of director John Hillcoat, and features a haunting score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. Harsh and uncompromising, we guarantee you have never seen a western quite like this before.

Right after the GM, we'll be screening David Lynch's bizarro cult classic WILD AT HEART
_______________________________________
Dir. David Lynch - 1990 - USA

WILD AT HEART stars Nic Cage and Laura Dern as Sailor and Lula, two young lovers who embark on a cross-country road trip, pursued by a rogues gallery of menacing weirdos that Lula’s mother has hired to kill Sailor.  The film won the Palme d’Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival and it was certainly a bold choice.  By turns hilarious and horrifying, with an on-point soundtrack, a colourful cast of characters, occasional references to the Wizard of Oz, and show-stopping performances delivered by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, this is David Lynch at his most flamboyantly strange and deliriously entertaining.  Oh, and if you’ve ever wanted to see Nic croon along to Elvis, then this is the movie for you.  Come along for a crime thriller-comedy-musical-road movie like no other.

The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film a few years back and Mads Mikkelsen (of Hannibal and Casino Royale fame in the US) took home a Cannes best actor award for his phenomenal performance as Lucas. It's a heart-breaking, nuanced film, and certainly not one you want to miss.

A traveling movie theatre screens the 1931 film ""Frankenstein"" for the village, and seven-year old Ana (Ana Torrent) is haunted by the scene in which a young girl is drowned. Anchored by the unforgettably solemn yet curious gaze of its young star, the film is enigmatic, bewitching, visually arresting, and rich in symbolism.

This beautifully shot film, the second by Nicolas Roeg, and has become one of the most iconic Australian films (despite its British director) and one of the more progressive and realistic representations of the Australian outback. It's not one you want to miss.

A multi-coloured, multi-dimensional gem, Speed Racer changed the FX game. So put aside your initial skepticism and give it a go.

But as the scheme is set into motion, it starts to look like their best-laid plans might not be as watertight as they thought. With whip-smart, rapidfire dialogue, a twisty, time-hopping plot and slick film noir touches, THE KILLING is a stylish and thrilling bit of genre fun.

Welcome to FilmSoc for 2016.

We’re kicking off the year by spending a few days in the cap-toe leather shoes of Manhattan businessman-cum-psychopath Patrick Bateman. Adapted from Brett Easton Ellis’ infamous novel, American Psycho went criminally underappreciated in 1999 but has since lingered in the minds of sadists and cult aficionados alike. Led by a chilling yet hilarious performance by Christian Bale, this subversive horror-comedy is a must-see portrait of 80’s excess.

The screening will be held at Hermann's Bar from 7pm on Thursday during week 1. Entry is free for Access cardholders and $10 for non-access.

One of the most influential short films ever made, Meshes of the Afternoon simultaneously makes perfect sense, and is completely ambiguous. Surrealistic and bleak, Maya Deren expresses her unique feminist perspective through a variety of stylistic innovations.

In Le Bonheur, Agnès Varda zeroes in on the apparently idyllic existence of a French family. Though simple and sunny on its surface, this classic of the French New Wave ditches moralistic clichés in favour of a more complex and idiosyncratic reflection on the pursuit of happiness (""le bonheur"") in modern relationships.

The documentary follows von Trier as he challenges his friend and film mentor, Jørgen Leth to remake Leth's short film ""The Perfect Human"" five times, each with a different 'obstruction' imposed. The obstructions vary from location, to form, and to cast - each offer fascinating variations of an underappreciated film by a criminally underappreciated filmmaker.

Stephen King said, ""You don't watch it so much as experience it"". Jennifer Kent's debut feature film is a chilling psychological - and slightly Freudian - study of a mother and her son as they match wits with a fictional monster that seems all too real. No stone is left unturned in creating a haunting sensory experience: from the intimate sound design to Noah Wiseman's disturbingly deft portrayal of protagonist Amelia's son Samuel. If you missed The Babadook in cinemas - and you probably did in its feeble, 13-screen Australian release - now's your chance to see the film that Peter Bradshaw said ""leaves behind it a satisfyingly toxic residue of fear"".

With FX's popular anthology show, Fargo, about to enter its second season, it's high time we all revisit the film that inspired it.

Often remembered for the quirky Midwesternisms of its characters (""Yah?

Directed with unfaltering panache and populated by a cast boasting some of America's best character actors (see: Frances McDormand, William H Macy, Steve Buscemi), Fargo is an inspired and hugely entertaining movie by two of the most important filmmakers working today.

FilmSoc screened Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s masterpiece Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall Past Lives as our final film last year, though it has often been considered inferior to the more personal, intimate and innovative Tropical Malady, which Weerasethakul released 10 years ago.

Tropical Malady evokes the same trademark surrealism as the filmmakers later works, however, it is more reflective of Weerasethakul’s background as an experimental queer filmmaker, as well as well as his relationship with his Thai heritage and culture. Tropical Malady is a very rare film, and without a doubt one of the most important films of the last ten years.

Bar TOKYO STORY, LATE SPRING is perhaps Yasujiro Ozu’s most prominent work. The film also stars Setsuko Hara - often regarded as the most important actress of Ozu’s era - in one of her definitive roles. The film is a slow-moving, typical Ozu film, however, it is one that works on perfecting these ‘trademark’ characteristics, with LATE SPRING emerging as one of Ozu’s most critically lauded works to date. Arguably Japan’s most influential filmmaker, Ozu’s LATE SPRING is essential viewing as an entry point into the incredibly intricate and broad film landscape that is Japanese cinema.

We’re back from our brief hiatus with this classic screwball comedy, directed by the master of American screwball, Ernst Lubitsch.  Set in Nazi-occupied Poland during WWII, the film revolves around a troupe of Polish actors who are swept up in a plot to prevent a German spy from delivering a potentially catastrophic message to the enemy.  Madness ensues.  From its surprisingly bold approach to its then-topical subject matter (the film was made and released while the war was in full swing) to its sharp, energetic blend of comedy, romance, suspense, and satire, this is a remarkable and wholly delightful film.

***DESCRIPTION***
dir. Claire Denis - 2008 - France

Claire Denis is one of the pre-eminent figures of contemporary world cinema, with films concerned with family and relationships as well as cross-cultural tensions, stemming from her colonial African background which informs her work.

35 Shots of Rum is arguably her masterpiece, and perhaps the best example of her work as associated with that nebulous term of ‘contemplative cinema’ – films of great subtlety, long take aesthetic, mood and showing rather than telling – and the most obvious nod to Yasujiro Ozu, the great master that is perhaps her greatest influence, in its ostensible reworking of Late Spring (which we are screening in Week 11). The masterfully woven tale of a father and daughter’s changing relationship is both simple in plot and expansive and affecting in its implications and feeling, an instant classic of French cinema.",2014-09-24T17:00:00+1000,Old Geology Lecture Theatre,Sydney,Australia,,2006.0,-33.884864127391,151.18768649816002,0.0,0.0

If you want to be more involved with Sydney's biggest and best student film society, then we'd love to see you put your hand up for one of the available exec positions.

POSITIONS TO BE ELECTED, in the following order: 
-President
-Vice-President
-Secretary
-Treasurer
-Events Officer
-Sponsorship Officer
-4 x General Executive

Full agenda and details on what each position involves will be issued shortly.

Bear in mind that you can nominate yourself for more than one position, but if you are elected to one of the positions, you cannot run for the subsequent ones.  (e.g. if you nominate for Secretary, but you don't win that round, then you can still nominate for any of the subsequent positions. However, if your nomination is successful, you can't then run to be an Events Officer, and so on.)

Also, if you can't come to the meeting, don't worry: you can submit your nomination in advance by sending us an email (usydfilmsoc@gmail.com) with your name, Access card number, and the position(s) you are nominating for.
You can also send us a few words about why you'd be a good fit for that position/why you'd like to be more involved with FilmSoc/any ideas that you have for the society that we can read to the meeting in your absence (optional).

It’s as much about expression as it is repression, and while it’s co-funded by Spike Lee, it’s written and directed by first-time filmmaker Dee Rees, whose story Alike’s is inspired by.

With THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, Luis Bunuel transforms the sacrosanct bourgeois ritual of dinner into a platform for social critique. Surreal and satirical in equal measure, watch society's upper crust devolve into chaos as plans for a dinner party are thwarted time and time again, with each incident becoming more ludicrous than the last.  Despite completely eschewing logic and plot, it's a unique experience that somehow remains utterly enthralling and highly enjoyable.

1144,Filmsoc.USyd,FilmSoc Week 6: CLOSE-UP,5,2,39,0,2,48,"dir. Abbas Kiarostami - 1990 - Iran

Close-Up has got to be one of the most dazzling films to emerge from the Iranian New Wave, a movement known for films that are intellectually challenging and conceptually ambitious, yet deceptively simple and elegant in execution.

Based on a real-life case, its narrative focuses on a man who is put on trial for impersonating a famous filmmaker.  We are swiftly notified that we are watching a blend of documentary and fiction, a sort of dramatised re-enactment in which every person involved in the original events plays themself.

By blurring the boundaries between reality and re-construction, Kiarostami’s film develops into a playfully self-reflexive and quietly engrossing inquiry into the nature of the cinematic image itself - a treat for any cinephile.

If you feeling like working up some political outrage on a Wednesday evening, then come along to our screening of Z.  Drawing heavily from an actual incident that occurred in Greece in 1963, this French-language film portrays the events following the assassination of a prominent politician, tracing a young magistrate’s attempts to uncover the evidence that will allow him to apprehend those responsible.

It’s not hard to see why Z was an international box office hit in its time – it’s a perfectly paced, stylishly directed political thriller underpinned by a blood-boiling story of corruption and conspiracy that maintains its potency today.

Lore is a bildungsroman from an unconventional perspective, set in the aftermath of WWII. After her Nazi parents are captured by the Allied forces, a young girl, Lore, is tasked with taking her siblings through the Black Forest to their grandmother's house. What unfolds is Lore’s realisation of the terrifying disjunct between insular propaganda and the world as it is. In the hands of Australian filmmaker, Cate Shortland, Lore proves to be a poetic and subtly disturbing tale of the dissolution of innocence.
