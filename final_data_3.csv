Joel knows consulting. After graduating he spent time with Grant Thornton's Recovery and Reorganisation team, and Deloitte's Strategy and Operations team, before beginning his career at EY in Performance and Improvement Advisory. He is one of EY's best internally-rated consultants, with experience in Education, Construction, Financial Services and Healthcare. He is eager to share the process he pursued in one of his engagements, to give us insight into how great consultants work. His advice will be invaluable to students who want to stand out in their applications to work in financial services.
 
He has paused his career at EY to work as General Manager of Nexus Notes, where he oversees a peer-to-peer marketplace used by ~1.5 million University students across Australia and New Zealand to sell and buy summary notes. It's a profitable startup turning over 150k in revenue per year, with 10K users already on the platform internationally. In 2015, it received seed funding through Australia's leading accelerator 'Startmate' which is backed by Blackbird Ventures. Later in 2015 the founders pitched on SharkTank AU. The venture was co-founded at Sydney University and Sydney remains the largest market to date. Students who have put effort into their notes can make easy money and also benefit from mentoring opportunities, job references and access to exclusive events and networking sessions with access to major commercial and legal firms.
 
Joel will be providing unique end to end insight into how a successful project is run at a consulting firm, by breaking down the process and highlighting the various stages of preparing a deliverable. He will also be highlighting how best to take advantage of great opportunities through Nexus Notes. The workshop will be interactive and audience participation is expected!

REGISTRATIONS ARE NOW OPEN: t.uber.com/launchchallenge

❂ ❂ ❂ 

Uber launched in San Francisco in 2010. Today, they've helped over 2 billion people reach their destination in 450+ cities around the world.

The Uber Launch Challenge invites all University of Sydney students in teams of 2-3 to pitch an expansion strategy for real-life Uber products, as Uber continues to evolve the way cities move.

The winning team from each Campus Heat will receive an all expense paid trip to our Australian Regional Headquarters in Sydney and the opportunity to pitch to the Uber Leadership Team.

THE CHALLENGE:
The Uber Launch Challenge 2017 theme is ‘Shared Rides’

From Sydney to São Paulo, we’ve been working hard to get to know our cities, with the goal of making them safer, smarter, more accessible and less congested. Our bold experiments in shared rides technology are making this mission a reality, with products including uberPOOL, uberHOP and uberCOMMUTE.

The Challenge places you on the frontline as we launch these products in new markets. Teams will be given the opportunity to:
- Analyse demand and supply levers, turning raw data into actionable insights; 
- Define a launch strategy and incentive scheme to encourage early adoption and rapid growth of both driver-partners and riders; 
- Build a business model, optimising Uber’s core metrics to ensure operational excellence at scale.

THE PRIZES:
The Campus Heat winners will receive an all expense paid trip to Sydney to compete in the Finals on 20th May. The top three teams will be awarded up to $1,500 in Uber rides or UberEATS credits, and the first place team will earn guaranteed interviews for the 2018 Uber Graduate Program.

The Challenge is open to students at all universities across Australia and New Zealand, with Campus Heats taking place at the following universities: University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, University of Adelaide, Australian National University, University of Western Australia, and University of Auckland.

Ladies and gentlemen of business schools and other faculties around NSW (yes, tonight we'll let it slide and accept you as one of us). As the dark cloud, better known as Semester 2 looms and begins to cast its shadow, we at SUBS feel that something must be done. 

So, in heroic business student fashion, we have decided to take ownership of this 
abhorrent responsibility. Let us take action and rise above this ominous fog that is Semester 2. Let us get ridiculously turned up. Let us rebel against the system and prove that we can and will party like the future CEOs.

What is expected:

- LOTS of camo and other military themed outfits. Dress up people. Now is not the time to be afraid. Embrace the camo. 

- 'Sun's out, gun's out' is a policy that we're going to have to enforce--sorry. It may be winter, and it will be night time, but all you bronzed beauties that have just arrived back from Europe and successfully teased us Sydneysiders with your 24-7 Insta updates, it's time to take one for the team. We don't care if it's 10C. Guns out people, guns out. 

- Shots shall be fired all night long. Just as Lionel Richie always intended.

As a continuation on the Monday Law Career Basics Panel, 'All the light touches – grappling with the legal landscape', this Wednesday Panel will focus on building skills and relationships in your legal career, whether in your part-time job or grad job. 

Presented by Kate Samolej, the first half of the panel discussion will focus on developing skills in the following areas:
1. Developing a reading and writing style of a legal practitioner.
2. Developing a feel for junior court appearances
3. Building relationships with other practitioners and the Counsel/Solicitor relationship

The panel will then discuss how to take advantage of these skills, especially when it comes to utilising them to form relationships. If you are a quiet achiever, this event will especially help you as we will talk about how to best develop yourself and your network if you are more introverted as we will delve into ""law for the soft spoken”/introvert v extrovert themes.

Finally, the panel will help dissipate the idea that marks are everything, and prove that life (and employment) does happen without a distinction average.

Our Panellists include:
Meher Gaven – Barrister, Eight Wentworth Chambers
Renée Bianchi – Barrister, 13th Floor St James Hall Chambers, Chair of the Young Lawyers Committee of the Law Council of Australia 
Beverly Parungao – Paralegal at Jones Day, formerly Legal Assistant at 12 Wentworth Selborne Chambers 
Elizabeth Toriola – Paralegal at Corrs Chambers Westgarth, formerly Legal Assistant at 12 Wentworth Selborne Chambers

SydneyUniversityLawSociety,SULS Presents: PLT Day,49,46,308,0,46,449,"So you're probably at the point in your life where you're thinking two things: 1) the phrase ""legal profession"" enlivens a deep trauma that can only be added to by the words ""take home""; and 2) now that i've (nearly) got my law degree, what do I do next? 

Your Practising Certificate is the next step in your legal training, and a competency requirement to be admitted as a solicitor in New South Wales. Lucky for you we're making learning about that next step a whole bunch of fun - with the brand new PLT Day held on Tuesday of Week 12 from 1pm to 3pm. A range of PLT providers will be coming in to discuss their programs and how customisable and flexible they are for students of all needs. 

So drop into the law foyer and listen to the presentations (from 1pm to 1:30pm). After that, all our providers will hang around until 3pm to answer whatever questions you have for them (there's free tea and snacks). 

N.B. Whilst students who choose to work with a commercial firm will sometimes have their PLT provided in the course of employment, many (traditionally smaller) firms do not offer this.  If you're looking to work for a barrister, government, a judicial representative, it's likely you'll have to arrange your own PLT training. Additionally, if you're thinking of working in another industry, with the thought of potentially going into legal practice later, you should be aware of the 5 year ""stale-degree"" rule that requires you to be admitted within 5 years of graduating your law degree. 

We look forward to seeing as many people as possible at PLT Day to help you decide how to best progress your legal education!",2017-10-24T13:00:00+1100
SydneyUniversityLawSociety,People of Colour in the Legal Profession,33,33,425,0,33,524,"The People of Colour in the Legal Profession Panel Discussion and Networking event is an exciting new SULS event running for the first time in 2017! It will feature a diverse panel of individuals who have achieved success in their professional careers, and have extensive personal experience with ethnocultural issues in the workforce. 

While Australia has an impressive and increasingly significant multicultural foundation, it is evident that this is not reflected in the composition of senior leaders in business and legal professions. This event is designed to explore the cultural barriers people of colour may still face in the legal sector. 

Many law firms have robust programs to support and promote the role of wom*n and LGBTQ+ people in their communities, and many are committed to Reconciliation Action Plans - but to what extent is the Australian legal profession aware of and committed to addressing intersections of disadvantage, prejudice, unconscious bias, and resultant lack of diverse representation amongst its members? To what extent is race a barrier, and how is it addressed? 

The evening will include a Q&A session where students can raise any personal queries and the latter half of the evening will be a networking night. 

Our panelists include: 
Lisa Annese (CEO of Diversity Council Australia)
Chris Ronalds SC (Chair of the NSW Indigenous Bar Association’s Indigenous Barristers Strategy Working Party) 
Dai Le (Founder of Developing Culturally Diverse Leadership (DAWN))
Penina Su (Final year LLB student at Sydney Law School and Summer Clerk / Paralegal at Herbert Smith Freehills)

Simba, we'll show you the legal lay of the land.

Presented by Kate Samolej, this event is intended to provide students with and understanding of the legal landscape. SULS Careers will be inviting ex-student panellists who have work experience outside of the clerkship context, such as volunteers, small firms, courts, chambers and in-house, and can de-mystify what these roles entail as well as provide tips about how to successfully apply to and work in the profession.

Our lunchtime panel will share their experiences of starting out and advise the audience on “how to ask” – where to look, who to speak to, and how to gather the courage to aim a little bit higher than you think your CV might allow you to. We'll also highlight the importance of finding out what your goals are and deciding on the kind of workplace that best suits you, as well as showcasing that small firms are not synonymous with wills, conveyances and “small things”, but rather there is a wealth of boutique firms out there who undertake exciting work.

Finally, this seminar will touch on how to form relationships - how to get noticed, start getting out of your shell and how to grow your interaction with other practitioners over time, which is a vital skill for aspiring law students. This last point will be expanded in our second Law Career Basics Seminar, 'Little steps – Building skills and relationships' on Wednesday 25th of October from 1-2pm in the Law Foyer. 

Lunch will be provided. If you can’t make this event, please attend our Wednesday panel. Although in includes slightly different content, you will have the opportunity to ask about the same topics, and you will be able to meet esteemed barristers!

Our panellists include:
- Georgia Allen: Intern at the Australian Law Reform Commission, Constitutional Reform Unit, Research Assistant at the Judicial Conference of Australia

- Tiarne Wadey: Paralegal, Office of General Counsel University of Sydney

- Abi Smith: Dispatch Officer at NSW Police Force, Paralegal in Barrister Chambers, currently Paralegal at Djekovic Hearne and Walker Solicitors

SydneyUniversityLawSociety,SULS Social Justice Conference 2017: Beyond the Buzzword,58,74,519,0,74,725,"The Sydney University Law Society invites you to attend its annual Social Justice Conference for 2017 - BEYOND THE BUZZWORD: SOCIAL JUSTICE IN PRACTICE. 

This one-day conference will seek to provide guidance in exploring the multiple career and life pathways that are available to 'social justice'-minded students after university. What more is there, practically speaking, behind that buzzword? It will encourage you to think critically about the sort of impact you are really having on your way to enacting pragmatic, productive and long-term social justice initiatives.

With a stellar line-up of speakers over the course of the day, we hope to delve into some of the trickier questions about practising 'social justice' as activists and lawyers-in-waiting, such as:

- How do we ensure not-for-profit organisations are culturally sensitive and providing long-term solutions? 
- What role, if any, does the private sector play in facilitating access to justice? Is this sustainable? Is it good?
- Is 'Corporate Social Responsibility' just good marketing? Is it real? Is it helpful?
- What is the difference between Legal Aid and Community Legal Centres? 
- Are some of these organisations redundant in providing social justice or do they each have a genuine role to play? How could they be better? How can we?
- What does it mean to be 'culturally competent'? Why is it important?
- What can students do, whilst they're at university, to prepare themselves for careers in the 'social justice' or 'public interest' sectors?
- What jobs are out there? What should we be looking for?

To mix things up, lunch and afternoon tea will be catered by the excellent PARLIAMENT ON KING - a local social enterprise providing delish, diverse foods whilst training refugees, asylum seekers, and recent arrivals to Australia to work in hospitality. 

Spots are very limited - so to secure your place (and your lunch), please register as soon as possible via the following link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10eYCAmoqGS9ddCPh42PnohKV1KaTOcFf89n-mZh2AXc/viewform?edit_requested=true

Law in Society is SULS’ bi-annual journal on the law and topical issues affecting the wider community. The theme for this semester’s edition is law and technology. In light of the theme, the journal will be moved to a purely digital online platform and will accept a diverse range of submissions, including short videos and documentaries, Twitter essays, fiction pieces and artwork. As in the past, academic submissions are welcome. 

To be considered for publication, contributors must submit an abstract. Abstracts should be between 200 - 300 words and include an outline of the topic, format of the submission (e.g. written, video, data set) and genre (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, comment, academic analysis). If your submission is academic, it should include the major points to be covered and the proposed length of the final submission (the minimum length being 1500 words, maximum 3000). If you have a submission in mind that is outside the formats listed, we highly encourage you to submit an abstract regardless and if possible a sample of the work. If you’d like to have a look at past editions of Law and Society, they can be found here:  http://www.suls.org.au/law-in-society/

***Abstracts will be accepted from students of all faculties, as well as those who do not attend the University of Sydney.***

PLEASE SUBMIT ABSTRACTS TO lawinsociety@suls.org.au email with the subject line “Law in Society: Abstract Submission” by 5.00pm on 25 AUGUST 2017. If you have any questions about submitting an abstract, feel free to contact us at that address. 

LAW AND TECHNOLOGY

The 21st century has seen unprecedented developments in technology, but with new advances come new problems. New technologies have created modern regulatory challenges and ignited widespread ethical debates. In this edition of Law in Society, we invite contributors to think of law and technology from a variety of perspectives and dimensions. Potential topics for submissions include:
- Privacy protection and the use of surveillance for social control
- New technological solutions for access to justice
- Employment and technology: e.g. the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on workers’ rights
- “Hacktivism”: e.g. the leaking of secret documents to Wikileaks for ethical reasons and democracy, international law and the protection of whistleblowers, the use of “hacking” as a form of activism by Anonymous and other groups
- Cybercrime regulation: e.g. the recently introduced NSW  “revenge porn” laws
- Ethical concerns with misuse of “big data” and the information economy: e.g. protecting privacy and autonomy, use of big data to violate rights of procedural fairness and target particular communities
- Regulation of biotechnology and new life sciences: e.g. ethical issues with patenting of seeds and natural produce, genetic modification, legal ownership of private medical data and DNA
- Responding to information warfare and cyber-terrorism",2017-09-03T23:00:00+1000

The first issue of Blackacre was published in 1924. Since then Gough Whitlam, Geoffrey Robertson, David Marr, Bob Ellis and many other famous lawyers/nerds/pollies have written articles, drawn comics and scribbled profanities in its pages. You could be next to join them!

We want this year’s Blackacre to reflect the thoughts and feelings of as many as possible from the class of 2017. To do so we need a big team of contributors who want to help sculpt their yearbook.

There are heaps of ways you can contribute! Here are a few–

1. Writing – we want fiction and non-fiction articles about your time at Law School. They can be as fun or serious as you like! You can write an essay about issues at Sydney Law School you would like addressed; you can write a story about the funniest thing which happened to you at Law Ball. You can write naughty things anonymously or you can write ballads which you will be proud to show mum and dad and we will publish your name in big letters.

2. Drawing and painting – please please come help us if you can draw and paint. We want this year’s Blackacre to be especially visual, and we need final year students to design our cover page, draw comics, have crafternoons.

3. Design (using computers) – these days almost all magazines are designed with some computer assistance. If you know how to use the Adobe Suite and want to help shape the layout of the magazine we would love to have you! No great level of experience needed.

4. Literally anything else – if you want to play a role but aren’t sure how, please get in touch anyway!

5. Keep an eye out about bios – every final year student gets a biography and photo! Soon we are going to be putting questionnaires, please keep your eyes peeled and help us make you look good!

Want to be involved? Email us at blackacre@suls.org.au pitching a piece or just saying hi.
Not sure and want more info? Email us at blackacre@suls.org.au with any questions.
Just like sending emails? Email us at blackacre@suls.org.au

Race is modern Australia’s battleground for equality, hope and identity.

ABSTRACTS

To be considered for publication, contributors must submit an abstract. Abstracts should be a maximum of 300 words, and should explain how the submission will relate to the theme, include a potential title and outline the main points to be covered by the final submission.

The journal welcomes academic and creative submissions, including interviews, short stories and visual art. Academic submissions should be between 1500 and 3000 words. Abstracts will be accepted from both law and non-law students, including those who do not attend the University of Sydney, and may be anonymous.

The deadline for abstracts is 11.59pm on 12 June 2017.

DISRUPT

Social justice is an act of disruption. From the Freedom Riders of 1965, who stood outside segregated areas in country towns protesting for Aboriginal rights, to the 200 000 people that opposed the Iraq war, to current protests against the Adani Coal Mine and the treatment of asylum seekers, justice has often been sought through disruption. 

In a legal context, disruption calls into question the prison industrial complex, the judicial system, and expanding executive power. Disruption can also be imposed, rather than sought, with advances in technology posing new legal and ethical questions for social justice. 

Potential topics for submissions include: 
– Civil disobedience: police powers and anti-protest laws
– Criminal law and technology: sexting and image-based sexual abuse laws (e.g. ‘revenge porn’) and reform laws
– Employment and technology: the impact of automation on worker rights, disciplinary technologies in the workplace
– Re-imagining the criminal justice system: disruptive modes of rehabilitation
– Public International Law in the age of Trump
– Environmental law: disrupting fossil fuel dependence
– Media Law: disruptions to privacy",2017-06-19T23:59:00+1000

It will feature a range of Sydney University / Sydney Law alumni who currently work in the ‘public interest’ sector - whether that be in community legal centres, education, policy and advocacy work, journalism or social justice-oriented consulting. 

Students will have the opportunity to hear a diverse range of speakers share their personal experiences forging careers in social justice, and pursuing alternative (i.e. non-corporate) pathways following their law degrees. Whilst some work as lawyers and others are in different sectors entirely, all have fascinating tips and tales to share about how they have used their legal skills to try and make some kind of difference, and to get where they are today. 

The event will include a Q&A session where students can raise any queries they have about getting involved with public interest initiatives at and beyond university and finding employment outside of the purely corporate legal space. 

Our panelists will include: 

Annabelle Chauncy (Founder of the School for Life in Uganda)
Roger West (Founder of social justice-orientated consulting firm Westwood Spice, formerly worked at Redfern Legal Centre and the NSW Community Services Commission)
Deborah Whitmont (Reporter for ABC’s Four Corners, formerly worked at Redfern Legal Centre and for ABC’s The Investigators)
Clare Petre (Chairperson of the Asylum Seekers Centre, formerly worked for the Energy & Water Ombudsman)
Niru Palanivel (Campaign Coordinator for Children out of Immigration Detention)

The modern world remains a subtly racial one. The last year witnessed the triumph of scepticism against 18C and subversion of multiculturalism in Australian workplaces, the home and society more broadly. Race is a skin we cannot remove, a mindset that shapes our identity and an object that threatens some, victimises others and forges privilege. Race is modern Australia’s battleground for equality, hope and identity.

Abstracts should not exceed 300 words and should outline the angle of the full submission as it pertains to race/ethnocultural narrative and/or the law.

The modern world remains a subtly racial one. The last year witnessed the triumph of scepticism against 18C and subversion of multiculturalism in Australian workplaces, the home and society more broadly. Race is a skin we cannot remove, a mindset that shapes our identity and an object that threatens some, victimises others and forges privilege. Race is modern Australia’s battleground for equality, hope and identity.

Abstracts should not exceed 300 words and should outline the angle of the full submission as it pertains to race/ethnocultural narrative and/or the law. Academic submissions are encouraged but submissions including reflective and creative poetry, prose, photo-essays and art will be highly regarded.

For the first time ever, we're taking on Japan! Our 11-day trip includes 5 days of powder skiing at the world class Hakuba resort followed by 3 nights partying in the heart of Tokyo. We are only taking 65 students for our first time, so spots on the trip are extremely limited.
 
With a vertical drop of over 1000m, Hakuba is regarded as having some of the best skiing the world which is perfecto for those who like it steep and deep! Our lodge has been booked exclusively by us and is located right next to the main gondola and a short walk to the restaurants, shops and most importantly, the bars. Your lift pass will also give you access to 11 other surrounding resorts which can be accessed by a free shuttle, giving you access to 146 lifts in total. For those taking a day off skiing we suggest you check out snowmobiling, the Snow Monkeys, the Zenkoji Temple or the local hot springs. Or just crack some tinnies early!
 
On February 10 we will be traveling back to Tokyo via the amazing Matsumoto Castle. We are then going to top it off with 3 nights in the heart of Tokyo for some sensory overload! So here are the details…

INCLUDED:
Direct Sydney – Tokyo flights
7 nights in Hakuba
3 nights in Tokyo
5 day lift pass
All transfters

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

1. Unfortunately Subski & Bamsoc aren't having a boat cruise this year because we actually hate having fun and Halloween sucks....

2. You've heard the whispers around campus, you've been thinking for months now about the ultimate Halloween costume and you're looking out for the best way to metaphorically kick Semester 2 into the harbour... or literally if you see fit.

Well hold on to your knickers, briefs, boxers, panties, undies or other undergarments because the 20th of October brings the biggest, baddest, most rambunctious event OF THE YEAR!!!

Did we mention it's on a boat??? 3 hours cruising around Sydney harbor, taking in the sights and being totally respectful (ha!) to your liver, brain cells and everything 2016 had to offer.... While on a boat.... For 3 hours.... With drinks.... In Halloween attire. Ahhhh yes please!!

Q) So how do I get a ticket? A) Unlike our other parties tickets to the boat cruise can only be bought online and THEY ARE LIMITED! We can't stress this enough guys, seen too many people miss out and have to spend their night crying in bed, cuddling their cats and listening to Adele. 

FINAL RELEASE TICKETS - $45

DEPARTURE: The boat will depart 6:30 promptly from the King St Wharf right outside Cargo Bar and will not wait for you. So DON’T BE LATE, or you'll be swimming. Aim to get there a bit earlier so you can board with ease and check out all the sexy Halloween costumes!

MUSIC: We'll have our very own Dj's providing you with next level beats from their pc computers and keeping the d floor raging until the very last person steps off the boat.

AFTER PARTY: Naturally the After Party will be taking place at Cargo Bar, which will be directly in front of you as you stumble off the boat. Nice and easy even if you are directionally challenged by that point. Oh also your wristband will get you cheaper drinks, yay!

Now that's about it so grab yourself a ticket and get excited for the greatest night of the semester, the year and possibly even all time! Yeeeww

We will hopefully have Auslan interpreters available on the night - stay tuned for details. All visual material will endeavour to use large, clear fonts and subtitles.

This event is fragrance free. Please avoid the use of strong and/or aerosolised scents (e.g. perfume or scented lotion) to accommodate the needs of people with hypersensory issues or allergic reactions. If this is a concern or you have any questions please contact the event organisers.

The Rat is cash-only. There is an ATM a hundred metres down the (relatively flat) road at a nearby service station.

The venue is ten minutes’ walk or wheel from Sydenham station, and from Sydenham station you can also get the M30 bus to just opposite the venue. The Red Rattler is also accessible by buses that go along Victoria Road, Marrickville (423, 426, M30).There is plenty of space out front for taxis/ubers to pull in and drop people off, and there is parking available.

More detailed access info to be posted in the event page below. If you have any queries about accessibility, or have specific accessibility requirements that aren’t covered by the information above, please feel free to contact the event organisers. You can reach Robin at robin.m.eames@gmail.com.

Come along one and all to the most fantastic and exciting social event of your journey through university. 

After you've completed just over 2 weeks of your baby steps into the University of Sydney we thought you'd appreciate the opportunity to get out of your comfort zone, broaden your horizon and generally ruin more cliches. 

Most importantly it is the best time to meet some new friends who you may share subjects with or even be part of the same niche society you forgot you signed up to during O Week. The SASS team wants to embrace students from the entire faculty whether you do Government, Gender Studies, Economics or Languages (and many more!). Even if you haven't decided what you want to specialise in, come along to Arts Camp to discover new people and new experiences! 

We'll be catching a bus down from the University quadrangle to our favourite campground on Friday afternoon and returning on Sunday afternoon. The days and nights will be filled with activities and a chance to socialise including our famous dance party on the last night with the theme of 'I can't believe you wore that!'. 

Alcohol will be provided*, although the event IS open to all ages (you youngun's under-18 won't be allowed to drink ofc). Camp Leaders from the 2017 Executive of SASS will be responsible for student's welfare and safety throughout the camp. 

Hit up this event or our facebook page here https://www.facebook.com/sydneyartssociety/ or email our President, Jacob Masina, sydneyarts.president@gmail.com if you have any questions!

Buses will leave from the front of the Quad at 2pm SHARP. So please gather there at 1 latest.

We’re kicking off summer with a big “f@#% you!” to exams, lectures, compulsory tutorials and every single internship application that you were supposed to fill out…

It’s time to forget the year’s course work you’ve temporarily crammed into your brains, let your hair down, knock back a 3-4 free drinks on entry, indulge in a subsidised bar tab for the rest of the night, and dance away any memory of study until you’re sweating more than Hillary Clinton watching the election unfold.

About this time of year, parents, siblings and friends are probably asking you what summer internship you got, maybe what graduate programme you applied for, or what boring f@#%ing rotation you selected as your first choice.

Things were a lot simpler when we were young and what we wanted to be simply jumped between the adventures of a fireman, nurse, policeman, pilot, doctor, or even the humble neighbourhood ice cream truck driver.
 
It’s time to bring these ones dreams back. If you wanted to grow up to be Peter Pan, a pop star, or the president of the USA, well to you I say: tonight is your night!

Dress up as whatever you dreamed of becoming as a kid, get down and party your way into Summer 2016/17!

This year we're still giving you a chance to get a lil dressed up, but we wanna spice it up and get VIVID as well. So break out your cocktail dress and button-up + blazer, but don't be afraid to throw in some colour as well - the more VIVID the better!

Arna 2015 came together as a shared vision to engage with Australia’s changing literary landscape; to push into the contemporary. Current Australian literary institutions, more often than not, isolate the voices of younger generations; there are preconceptions that we are either ill-informed, un-educated, inexperienced or invaluable. As an entirely student-run publication, we are proud to challenge these beliefs by offering diverse, dissident experiences. 

It is with great pleasure that we formally invite you along to celebrate the release of ARNA at 107 Projects. The night will feature readings from our contributors, free drinks, music, festivies and no entry fee.

Coming along, celebrate literature and celebrate your liver.

ACCESS: $100

There will be a woodland banquet served of three courses, along with the fermented drink of the lunar gods (read: unlimited booze).

Tables are for ten. After every member of your table buys their ticket, you may send a list of the ten names to socials@sydneyarts.org.au in order to secure a table. If you don’t send a list, we will randomise you into groups, so make sure you do! 

The rule from Arts Camp of ‘don’t be a dickhead’ still applies. If one were to transform into a dickhead before midnight, they will be exiled from the establishment and the nation of SASS. Please also don’t be a dickhead after midnight.

Wednesday the 22nd is game day, Arts' game starts at 11.30 sharp, if you're playing it'd be great if you could get there a little early for registration. Protective gear is optional, because we're using milo style couldn't-possibly-hurt-yourself-with-this cricket gear. 

Feel free to come watch, hang out and escape the horrors of election day. I don't know why you wouldn't, Arts is out in front as most attractive faculty (unofficial). There's no doubt you'll be all googly-eyed.

Brought to you by the Movers and Shakers, BAMSOC and Flairsoc, this night will be a lit outback sesh, with fresh produce from our humble farmers, including unlimited home grown organic Little Fat Lambs.  With an alleged appearance from Clive Palmer’s PUPs and Barnaby Joyce’s chins, we’ve gone into the bush to dig up the most dangerous and witchetty-grubby night imaginable. Take a moment to step away from your everyday urban horrors- compulsory tutes, bin chickens, and UTS- and step into our new home to enjoy the serenity. It’s a night that’s going straight in the pool room, so don’t miss out!

“STRUTH,” you exclaim, “$25 for a ticket?? Tell him he’s dreamin!” But rest assured, you’ve gotta lift to be game for a night like this: Unlimited Little Fat Lamb, Unlimited Tacos, and a fuck-tonne of banter. After we’ve silenced all of the lambs, kick on with us to Scary Canary for some true blue Scary jars and some good old line dancing.

2016 hit us all like a tonne of bricks, and it's time to use those bricks to build a wall, and make uni parties great again. Usyd lost it's Jacaranda, America has lot the plot, but your friend from UTS is still yet to lose his virginity; so let's make it all better with the most lit party since the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, roasting all of your mates for everything they've done in 2016.

In a Party more red hot than the finale of the Bachelor, we are set to host a night of emails you'll just have to delete, and snapchats Taylor Swift will say she never agreed to. Incollaboration with 8 societies from both USYD and UNSW, so it'll be the best night out to meet new people and just grab em by the wet pussy shot they're about to do!

So come dressed as your favourite emoji, and pray that this time when your crush sees it you're not going to get friendzoned again. It's gonna be the longest yeah boiiiiiii ever.

We're going to bring you $10 Cocktail specials and pizza platters all night. It's value so good if you leave it at home with Kim Kardashian someone's going to tie her up and steal it.
Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. You'll be looking pretty dumb if you don't come to this party, and instead just stay at home... on your forehead.

You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin

My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself

1. Unfortunately Subski & Bamsoc aren't having a boat cruise this year because we actually hate having fun and Halloween sucks....

2. You've heard the whispers around campus, you've been thinking for months now about the ultimate Halloween costume and you're looking out for the best way to metaphorically kick Semester 2 into the harbour... or literally if you see fit.

Well hold on to your knickers, briefs, boxers, panties, undies or other undergarments because the 20th of October brings the biggest, baddest, most rambunctious event OF THE YEAR!!!

Did we mention it's on a boat??? 3 hours cruising around Sydney harbor, taking in the sights and being totally respectful (ha!) to your liver, brain cells and everything 2016 had to offer.... While on a boat.... For 3 hours.... With drinks.... In Halloween attire. Ahhhh yes please!!

Q) So how do I get a ticket? A) Unlike our other parties tickets to the boat cruise can only be bought online and THEY ARE LIMITED! We can't stress this enough guys, seen too many people miss out and have to spend their night crying in bed, cuddling their cats and listening to Adele. 

FINAL RELEASE TICKETS - $45

DEPARTURE: The boat will depart 6:30 promptly from the King St Wharf right outside Cargo Bar and will not wait for you. So DON’T BE LATE, or you'll be swimming. Aim to get there a bit earlier so you can board with ease and check out all the sexy Halloween costumes!

MUSIC: We'll have our very own Dj's providing you with next level beats from their pc computers and keeping the d floor raging until the very last person steps off the boat.

AFTER PARTY: Naturally the After Party will be taking place at Cargo Bar, which will be directly in front of you as you stumble off the boat. Nice and easy even if you are directionally challenged by that point. Oh also your wristband will get you cheaper drinks, yay!

Now that's about it so grab yourself a ticket and get excited for the greatest night of the semester, the year and possibly even all time! Yeeeww

Ladies and Gentlemen, much like a successful tune for our society president Edwin Ho, the first event on the BAMSOC calendar has been a long time coming. There will be cheek, there will be Nandos, there will be banter.

There'll be hot chicks, glazed at 420 degrees and seasoned rare with Pepe-Pepe sauce. Not only is this a feast for all the senses but short of completing FIFA 17 and starting a riot, cheeky nandos with the lads and lasses is as quintessentially British as the Queen.

WHERE: Eastern Avenue, University of Sydney
WHEN: 10am-3pm, Thursday 7th May 2015

Please come down and support the cause! ALL donations goes towards the Nepal Earthquake Relief funds. 

If you cannot make it on the day, please feel free to donate to our Everyday Hero page on World Vision Australia, there is no minimum amount and all funds will be directly sent to World Vision Australia! 
https://nepalappeal2015.everydayhero.com/au/fabsoc-for-nepal


FABSOC (Fashion & Beauty Appreciation Society) is aiming to raise at least $1,000 and clothing donations, where 100% of donations raised will assist orphanages, organisations, hospitals and families in receiving the required treatment, equipment and funding needed to rebuild their lives and help Nepal. We will be donating 100% of funds to World Vision Australia where they will distribute funds accordingly. 

At FABSOC, we aim to use fashion as a segue for good causes and charitable work, as well as promote self-confidence and awareness through fashion. Through our fundraiser, we aim to promote our philanthropist nature and humanitarian values to help Nepal overcome this natural disaster, where a tumultuous earthquake of a magnitude of 7.9 struck Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal on the 25th April 2015. 

So far there have been over 6,000 deaths and an exponential amount of casualties and injuries. Nepal has a population of 27.8 Million people, where 50% of it's population are young children under the age of 18. Due to the increasing number of casualties, hundreds of thousands of children have been critically injured, separated from their families or are still trapped beneath the rubble and debris. Nepal as a nation has always suffered from impoverishment, governmental issues and a lack of infrastructure, due to this it's important to keep in mind that Nepal is desperately struggling during this time due to its LEDC status. 

Please keep Nepal in your hearts at this turbulent time, any donations, items of clean clothing or words of support is encouraged and welcomed.

The week after LOCUS (when we're all feeling the post-show comedown) is ALSO the first week of the Revue Season! So what better way to get our fixes than to go see some comedy on campus!

'What is a revue?' you may ask.

'Well, young Padawan, a revue is a sketch comedy show, packed to the brim with sketches that will make your sides split, great music theatre dancing and extraordinary musical comedy!'

'So how do I go?' you ask.

'WELL, you can check out the faculty revue Facebook event links below! And the night MADSOC will be attending next to it.'

To book your ticket, you can either use the link provided and book it through Seymour, OR if you want to sit with the rest of the MADSOC group, tick the box on the poll below. Keep an eye on Alysha Harrold's posts as she'll be booking the group tickets and it is her you will have to transfer the $$ to (if there are more then 10 in the group booking you get a discount!)

Sydney Uni's Movement & Dance Society has produced some quality productions over its few years in existence, but this show promises to be the biggest and best yet!

So whether you're a dance-lover, a dance-appreciator or know nothing about dance at all, come to experience Locus and enjoy the way our stories can be expressed through dance.
We've got you covered from contemporary, jazz, ballet to tap, hip hop, cha cha, Bollywood, and even some sick beat poetry.

The theme is ‘The Final Countdown’. So, basically it’s the last night on Earth, civilisation is crumbling all around us and you have ONE last crazy night to live it up… WHAT and WHO will you be? You decide how you want to spend your final night and what style/impression you want to give off. That could be reliving the glory days of your 90s pop childhood, or digging out that dusty flapper tap costume you once danced in… Or it could just be coming in your birthday suit… ya know, you do you! But whatever it is, make it count! This theme can literally encompass everything and anything, so if you’re thinking right now “ooh I don’t know about that.. does it even fit?” “Will I look weird?” “people won’t get this”…. JUST DO ITTTTT. We dare you. 

So, this epic party is in a few weeks (the Friday of week 13) and it’s taking place at none other than the Red Rattler Theatre in Marrickville, which for those of you who don’t know is the sickest, and grooviest venue EVERRR.

madsocusyd,The Stroke of Midnight: The 2014 Performing Arts Ball,242,43,356,0,43,684,"Once upon a time, in a strange world not too dissimilar to the Camperdown campus of the University of Sydney, there gathered four forces of a most ordinary kind:

MADSOC, SUDS, SURCAS and MUSE are proud to present The Stroke of Midnight: The 2014 Performing Arts Ball.

Following in the successes of 2013, the premier evening for performing arts on campus is here again to celebrate those who persist in (magically) wasting their time on stages. It’s a splendid excuse to get into obnoxious costume and rub elbows with those others at Sydney who hone themselves as entertainers – the nearest thing to real magic we have.

Of all the venues alluded to in the moving fables of Aesop, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, the most enchanting and fantastic is undoubtedly the Holme refectory. Transported from the drudgery of central Sydney, the venue is being specially reopened for this occasion, converted to a Germanic wood and princely ball, liable for the losing of many an unwanted child, and the finding of gingerbread houses.

The evening includes drinks, canapés and entertainment from all four societies, as well as live music and an invariably successful after party (we have booked a secret venue that lies in the fantasy lands beyond the reaches of the drink controlling tyrants, Baird and O’Farrell).

Last year the event sold out, so book early. Tickets can be purchased online here: http://www.trybooking.com/ERBW, and will not be sold on the door.

We're glad to have her back this semester teaching a weekly Lyrical Hip-Hop class with us, as well as serving as a guest choreographer for our Burlesque event ('SEXPRESS') at Verge Festival this October.

_______________________________________________________

MAGNETIC is a dance performance event that looks at the capacity of our bodies to affect and be affected. The show aims to leave audiences considering the different ways that bodies can mean and to highlight the body as an event, as a happening. How is consciousness shaped by the push and pull of different forces. What draws us in? What repels us? What forces exert on us and forge us into the beings we are today?

MAGNETIC is an experiment. What happens when you bring together 12 young and talented choreographers of different styles, working only with the concept of 'MAGNETIC' to bind them? How do choreographers, dancers, audiences make links between disparate and conceptual representations of 'MAGNETIC'? The end result is a hybrid production of hip-hop, contemporary, bellydancing, ballet, Argentine tango, jazz, rumba, tap & JFH.

MAGNETIC is an outlet for creativity, inspiration, interpretation, potential. It is founded on the fact that no dance style or embodied expression is more tenable or deserving than another. That no grand narrative or storyline is more important than the one you imagine as you take in the show. But more than anything...

MAGNETIC is potential...

Potential to be whatever you want it to be...be affected.",2013-09-20T20:00:00+1000,Seymour Centre,"Corner City Road and Cleveland Street, Chippendale",2008,-33.888222889412,151.1935542967

PERFORMING ARTS BALL 2013: THE BLITZ BALL

When the air-raid sirens wail most Londoners head for the shelters to wait out the night. But a select few, as fire rains from the sky, raise their glasses, unbowed and unbroken by the threat to their homeland. They fight the war with joy and laughter; eating, drinking, and dancing the night away, winning the battle for hearts and minds.

From London's high society to military personnel, domestic and international, the guests can be anyone. Dressed to the nines, and with the the refurbished nightclub-bunker fully stocked, Britain's finest musicians and performers are invited to entertain.

You are invited to the Blitz Ball.

Keep calm and party on.

For the first time ever in 2013, MADSOC will be part of interuniversity dance camp LE'GO! Packed with workshops, performances and social events, LE'GO will take place over the first three days of the Easter break. With dance societies from UTS, UNSW, UWS and Macquarie in attendance (not to mention our bro' from another mo', Soulxpress), this is an event not to be missed!

LE'GO welcomes dancers of all styles and levels, with one of its main events this year being inspired by the Vegas Group Rounds in So You Think You Can Dance. We'll be throwing five dancers from different styles together, giving them a short piece of music (it could be Usher...or Tchaikovsky! GASP) and asking them to come up with a fun and entertaining dance piece. (Don't worry, it's not as intimidating as it sounds, and the main thing is to have fun and make friends!)

So what are you waiting for? We're looking for anywhere between 10-20 happy campers from MADSOC to join us on our LE'GO adventure. Keep an eye on this page for more information and updates!

SHOW DESCRIPTION FOR PERTH AND ADELAIDE:

The worlds of sketch and clown combine in North and Clybourne's premier comedy adventure together. Come experience this collection of sketches and characters that play on the absurdities of what it means to be a human life form existing on these 3 axis of movement in the 3rd dimension on the 3rd planet from the sun.

This show will make you think about the important things in life, like folding sheets correctly and owning a new Audi r8.

SUDSusyd,SUDS Auditions: Punk Rock,1,36,338,0,36,411,"Punk Rock, by Simon Stephens

Show Dates: 7–17 March 2018

Available Roles: Lilly Cahill (Female)

Following one of our wonderfully talented cast members being accepted into NIDA’s acting program next year, we are looking to re-cast the roll of Lilly!
Punk Rock delves into the lives of seven students, heading towards their final exams in a private school in Stockport. A piece which could easily be mistaken for an off-beat romcom in its earlier scenes, quickly transforms as we are drawn into the students’ lives. Intimate moments reveal their concerns, their tenderness, their vulnerabilities. 
But the group interactions become sharper and more tense with every scene, as the students bully each other, lash out at one another, stand by and watch, and ultimately, push back. As the pressure builds and the group disintegrates, one character snaps with devastating consequence. If you swore you never wanted to relive Year 12, you’re going to want to make an exception for this one.

First round auditions will be held on 27 and 28 December, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 30-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Friday 29 December, and consist of between one and two-and-a-half hours of duologue work with other members of the ensemble.

To prepare for your audition:
1. Prepare the “Lilly” monologue. We want to be able to have a huge play with your monologue in the brief audition time we have, so memorisation is strongly encouraged!

You can find the monologue here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vypwRXmhboNkZxSHhlcXFjQms/view?usp=sharing

2. Read the script. It’s the point of reference for our work in the audition and callback, and taking the time to read the whole text before auditioning will be invaluable.

It is an analogy to the ropes hangmen use, sin and the sinner may just be left hanging. It is an analogy to the ropes couple use…for the lack of better words…for sexy time but be careful not to be bound for life. This story starts with Kira nearly drowning to her death. Dominic who coincidentally happened to be nearby saves her life. In that moment, the duo, along with two other friends, further develop their bond, with each dealing with their own toxicity and demons. This play is heavily focused on dialogue and storytelling, and also, of course, emphasising hope and human’s resilience in the battle against adversity and mental illnesses.""

Show Dates: 14–17 February 2018
Roles: 2 male, 2 to 6 female

Caress/Ache throws us into the lives of ten very different people, all affected and linked by touch. But not just the skin on skin contact we immediately think of. They are touched by ideals. A poem. A political cause. The stories in this play are an attempt to follow the many threads of what it means to be ‘touched’. We get to deftly leap from a loud, heartbroken couple fighting and interrogating a case of infidelity, to a hilarious first day of working at a phone sex line. There is light and dark, joy and grief. The struggle for our characters to connect in this world of touch builds to a yearning crescendo and breaks through in a final embrace. Thank goodness for catharsis, am I right? 

First round auditions will run from November 12th – 24th, and will consist of a brief discussion followed by working on a prepared monologue over the 20-minute audition. Callbacks will be on Sunday 3rd of December.

What can you do to prepare for your audition?

1. Prepare one monologue from those attached. To get the most out of your audition, memorisation is highly encouraged. That way you can show us your brilliant acting chops without being encumbered by a piece of paper!

Monologues to choose from can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zxz1FLl4PaNaMl-CPHgZJTPsOCOodWVC 

2. Read the script. While Wikipedia does have a pretty good blurb, reading the script will give you a more detailed idea of what you’ll be in for. It will also give you an accurate and all-encompassing depiction of the characters in the play, and can help you work out which one you would be most interested to play. On top of that, we’d love to chat and hear some of the ideas you have about the script as a whole during your audition.

Two dishonest bachelors both assume the identity of the very fictional Ernest Worthing in order to escape their own lives but are forced to meet the consequences of their actions when they are ultimately discovered.

Originally performed in 1895 Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People” is widely considered as the ultimate comedy of manners, examining the triviality of social conventions and obligations against the backdrop of polite society.

SUDSusyd,SUDS AGM 2017,31,23,245,0,23,322,"Hey hey heeey!!! Join us for the democratic event of the year! That's right, baby, we're voting in the SUDS warriors of 2018. The SUDS Annual General Meeting (AGM) ensures the continued existence of the oldest continuous drama society in Australia...by making sure we have an executive team so the USU does not deregister us. 
First, the President, Secretary and Treasurer will give you SUDSy reports about the year that was. Then, we vote! Every SUDS member can run for any position, and we encourage anyone who loves the society to put their name forward. 

We will be posting longer descriptions of the roles in the lead up to the event, but here is a brief outline of the roles that will be voted in at the AGM: 

President 
Reasonably self-explanatory. You are basically Big Brother - run the society, you are its face and voice, everything in the society comes back to you and you will be the first point of contact. For everyone. It's spooky but cool. 

Vice-President
An extremely flexible portfolio but one that is no-less important. You deputise and support the President. You're a helping hand to every portfolio and, aside from the occasional desire to stage a coup, you're an excellent Robin to SUDS's Batman. 

Treasurer
Money money money money. You give money to people who've spent money on the society's behalf, you plan a budget and conduct an audit at the end of the year. Think Scrooge McDuck but more fun and friendly. 

Secretary
You are responsible for the administration of the society. You manage memberships, take minutes, read the constitution lots. Best part: You manage space and time, as SUDS own in house Dr Who.

Publicity Officers
Like that annoying Facebook friend who doesn't know when to quit, your role is to literally throw notifications at people until they are brainwashed into going to EVERYTHING SUDS does. You'll run our social media accounts: twitter, Facebook, The Wash, our website, and you'll get everyone excited about what's coming up in SUDS. 

Social Secretaries
Oh the places you'll go! You get to plan all the social events for the society, with big $$ from our generous overlords (USU). You'll meet new people, and make them feel comfortable within the society but don't be fooled! This role has loads of admin as well. Use this opportunity to grow your social circle...

Cellar Officers
You are the Cellar's Fix It Felix and Inspector Gadget. You wil manage the tech and tools, teach others how to use them. You will attend bump-ins and bump-outs. You'll ensure everything is tidy, clean and adheres to safety standards. Safety standards will be your new best friends. 

Archivist
You are basically SUDS's foxy librarian. You are responsible for archiving all material from present shows as well as digitising and maintaining our ever-growing archival collection. 

HOW TO RUN: 
1. First things first, get in touch with the person who currently holds the position you want - they know a thing or two. Figure out what the role entails and what you want to do with it. 
2. We will vote the positions in the order above. For any position, you will need to be nominated - which you can do yourself or have a friend nominate you.
3. In the order of nomination, you will get a chance to sell yourself to the membership with a kick-ass speech. 
If you are running for President or Vice-President, you get 5mins and individual question time. 
All other positions get 3mins to speak. We will then run question time for each position, instead of each candidate. 

If you have any questions, concerns, thoughts, queries, qualms, the 2017 exec would love to hear from you! Seriously.. like, talk to us. We live for this

SUDSusyd,SUDS Presents: The Dark Room,82,45,446,0,45,618,"The Sydney University Dramatic Society Presents: The Dark Room

A lonely motel somewhere in the Northern Territory. Deep into the night, six lost souls play out a small, distant tragedy of lovesickness and social breakdown – only it’s not the same night. A teenage boy from a nearby country town waits for a stranger. Pregnant Emma waits for her husband, a country cop, wasted after his best friend's wedding. Anni, a government youth worker accompanied by a withdrawn and violent fourteen year-old girl, waits for the dawn. As the night draws on, each of them becomes trapped in dark and dangerous territory, each of them searching for a way out. 

Come along to the final SUDS slot of the year, and (hopefully) the final SUDS slot in the Common Room; an Australian play exploring the deep wounds caused by and through love, and the broken relationships it leaves behind. Join us as we interrogate the role of authority in administering justice, and question who we trust to protect us from each other.

SUDS Presents: Amédée or How to Get Rid of It
August 2nd-12th, 7.00pm
THE COMMON ROOM, HOLME BUILDING  

A comedy by Eugene Ionesco

“I can’t understand how we ever got into such a mess. It’s so unfair… And in a case like this… no-one to turn to for help and advice!...”

Amédée and Madeleine Buccinioni are a married couple who live in an apartment in Paris. They have not left this apartment for 15 years. Additionally… there is something unsettling in the next room. And its growing. 

Eugene Ionesco’s first full length, absurdist play deals with a decaying relationship haunted by past misdeeds and mistakes. Amédée, a playwright who has written only two lines of his play in 15 years and Madeleine, his disappointed and hardworking wife who is left to manage their increasingly dire situation. 

With an apartment that’s beginning to sprout mushrooms, ‘terrifying’ visits from the postman and something mysterious lurking in the next room, Amédée and Madeleine have created a world in their apartment which is strange and comical, yet at the same time immensely sad. Treated with characteristic wit, this tragic comedy goes deeper than just absurdity yet manages to touch the very heart of human relationships as we observe the severity of our actions and the danger of letting life pass you by…

“It beckoned to me, and I couldn't help but follow”

A series of disappeared persons line 100 years of Herald obituary sections. Despite the best efforts of the authorities, each search has proved fruitless.

As history begins to forget these lost souls, three social pariahs have come forward with a crazy theory they say links them all. So close to finding the answers and forever changing history, one of the group has mysteriously vanished; seemingly into thin air.

From the team behind the sold out immersive productions, ‘Weathervane’ and ‘a menagerie’, comes ‘In Two Circles’. Enter their world, be bold, and find your truth.

That is, until a mysterious disease starts infecting young people, one after the other. 

In the midst of the chaos of what will later be known as the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, a writer and a doctor are going to try and save as many of their friends and loved ones as possible, while their deepest convictions are shattering in front of the cruel emergency  caused by a vicious killer.

Hazelwood Jr. High
By Rob Urbinati

It’s 1989. Blue eyeshadow is in and hippies are out. Tiffany is so hot right now. Like something out of a John Hughes movie, six teenage girls traverse the halls of their high school.

See, there’s a new girl in town, Shanda. Amanda is totally in love with her. Melinda is pretty, popular and batshit crazy. Laurie Tuckett – she dropped out – is a psychopath. Hope is boy crazy and Toni can’t even get a date to homecoming.  

It’s just another day at Hazelwood Jr. High. But, as relationships bloom and people get dumped, a revenge plot is hatched. Things begin to spiral out of control. Open laughter moves from uncomfortable giggling to deep, dark silence.

It’s totally whacked out.

By Brad Fraser

Love and life are messy things — we get all tangled up as we look for connection and meaning in our existence. Things are complicated enough as it is, but add a serial killer into the mix and who knows what could happen…

Set in Edmonton, Alberta, the comedy-drama follows the lives of several sexually frustrated ‘thirty-somethings.’ Candy, who’s looking for the perfect man and true love; her homosexual roommate, David, who no longer believes love exists; Kane, a sexually confused teenager; Bernie, David’s troubled best friend; and Jerri, falling hopelessly in love with Candy. The otherworldly Benita, who overlooks the proceedings with a certain psychic knowledge. All of them try to learn the meaning of love — and all while a serial killer is terrorising the city, killing unidentified women…

Come viddy a real horrowshow that’ll knock you off yarblookos!

Translation: SUDS will be performing Anthony Burgess’s stage production of the novel (and Kubrick film) that was banned, glorified and idolised around the world: A Clockwork Orange. Tracking the story of 15 year old narrator, Alexander de Large, whose interests in sex, violence and Beethoven inevitably land him in prison, the administration of the controversial Ludovico technique begs the play’s overarching question: should humankind choose to be evil, or forced to be good?

Filled with delightful dark comedy and rife with references for true cinephiles and readers, come one, come all and view the cult classic adapted by SUDS.

SUDSusyd,SUDS Presents: Walking with Woolf,81,112,395,0,112,700,"The Sydney University Dramatic Society Presents: Walking with Woolf

Join us for a scintillating afternoon of performance on the sweeping lawns of the Quadrangle. Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” will be performed as never before. And, with any luck, as it will never be performed again! 

Follow the unfortunate journey of a motley cast and crew as they take on all the highs, lows and (often inevitable) disasters of student theatre. Watch them as things slide from bad to worse, forced to move from space to space, losing cast members and constantly running into less than cooperative characters along the way. But, as the age-old saying goes, the show must go on! Which in this case, means it must go on to the next performance space as soon as possible! 

SUDS’ “Walking with Woolf” will take you on an exciting (and manageable) journey around campus and will also feature performances from MUSE, SUSO and SURCAS. So come walk with us for a crash course in student theatre.

From Gillian: ""You want an abstract recipe for some vids involving me and some sexy interplay with food? All whilst I attempt to develop an interplay between identity, culture and consumerism within contemporary society? Yeh thought so... Its grotty, weird and feels like the furry sensation you get when you haven't brushed your teeth for a while. My mum doesn't like my films but yours does, what more can I say.""

There’s no way to describe this film without spoiling. It’s a short documentary, about 100 minutes, about parental relationships. There is a significant chance that this will be the festival favourite, and it’s an important palette cleanser after the film about robot cops.

Movie? STORIES WE TELL (2012) dir. Sarrah Polley.
Bit more recent than the last ones. Yes.
What am I supposed to just come without any real introduction to the movie? Trust me.

You said the films were too old, let’s get topical!

We’ll be serving, depending on the weather, HOT CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE (BYO IRISH); or ICY COLD RED BULLS.

RUN SHEET:

1AM: THE DEAD ZONE, dir. David Cronenberg. The film that launched the career of Christopher Walken, THE DEAD ZONE concerns a man suddenly able to see people’s futures by touching them. Incidental contact with a charismatic political candidate reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

3AM: THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP AS THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, dir. 62,979,879 American People and, according to some, Breitbart, 4chan, and Senator Bernie Sanders. The ceremony that launches a new era in America concerns a country suddenly able to see their future by voting incorrectly. THE INAUGURATION OF DONALD J TRUMP reveals a future of NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION.

tl;dr:

What time is this? The Inauguration starts around 3am, but to be safe we’ll be aiming for coverage from 2:30am. There will be a fun film shown immediately before.

Sunday, 15th January, 7pm for a 7:15pm start.

This week: Paul Verhoeven’s 1987 film, ROBOCOP.

The city of Detroit is in financial ruin and is about to be privatised by Omni Consumer Products. The underfunded Detroit Police Department threatens to strike. A corrupt board of corporate fat cats argues over who has the best disruptive app replacement for cops.

Despite how it sounds (a film about a Robot Cop), the film introduced American audiences to Verhoeven’s dark, sometimes-absurd style of satire. It’s filled with fake ads, Reaganomics, and the bad guy is played by the Dad from That 70s Show.

Movie? Robocop (1987) dir. Paul Verhoeven.
Didn’t that come out last year? No please it is NOT the remake it is VERY different.
Why would an international corporation want to buy Detroit of all places? Because you can save money not giving your citizens water.
Groan. What’s wrong I thought I sold this well?
I thought Courtney was picking the movie this time? I have barricaded myself in the Cellar to prevent this from happening but she is picking the next one.

It’s the height of Summer and there’s no better way to spend a humid Sunday evening than with your friends at the pictures.

First up: Spike Lee’s 1989 opus “Do The Right Thing”. The film depicts rising tensions in a Brooklyn suburb during a heatwave and was criticised at release for “inciting black audiences to riot”. 

Really what it did was clarify Spike Lee’s developing artistic vision. It’s a kinetic film, interspersed with slice-of-life vignettes that create a vibrant sense of neighbourhood previously absent from Hollywood’s grim, gawky portrayals of the ghetto. 

It’s equal parts funny and tragic and is, above all else, entertaining.

We’ll be serving popcorn and choctops on a pay what you want platform, there will be no ticket price at the door. We would advise all viewers to bring snacks and drinks themselves. This isn’t Dendy, we won’t be searching your bags. Free popcorn for anyone who brings a pillow to sit on, but there will also be enough chairs/pillows/comfy jackets from the costume room for all. 

We’re constructing a projector screen. We’ve keyed the cellar’s speakers to surround sound. We’ve torrented a bluray.* This is Alana Cherry’s projector as you have never seen before.

While they brag about their refurbished apartment, Vanek tries to be enthused. They gradually begin a verbal attack on Ferdinand, but, when he turns to leave, they beg him to stay, as they unveil that their latest project is him.

DOZENS OF COUSINS is twenty years in the future, placing Vanek back in the living room of Michael and Vera, shadowed by their maid Beda, for the same old games in a shiny new context: communism has died with a whimper and the Free World beckons with drugs, luxuries, and untold exotic wonders.

This double bill presents two of the infamous autobiographical Vanek Plays written by Vaclav Havel, recounting actual events from his life as a browbeaten artist, who would later bring about the fall of corrupt communism and establish the modern democracy that is the Czech Republic. They’re fast paced, funny, witty political farces.

How do we as creative people thrive and exist in a society which seems intent on telling us that what we have to contribute to society is useless bordering on irrelevant?

Do we kill ourselves?

Medicate legally or illegally?

Do we treat everything with a sheen of ironic pleasure, lulling ourselves in to a faint sense of blissful ignorance?

How do we navigate the murky waters of genuine heartfelt discovery that is constantly being probed and dismantled?

Maybe we should sit in the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY’S dankest hole nude peeling potatoes for 24ish hours where predominantly students of the VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY can gawk at us, staring at our genitals and giggling at the hilarity of it all, trying to think up meaning.

""Just an idea – an idea for a story. Young girl, lives on shore of lake since childhood – like you. Loves the lake – like a seagull. Then one day a man turns up, sees her, and mindlessly destroys her – just like this seagull.""

Konstantin dreams of writing the play that will forever change theatre. One hot, summer night he debuts his new work. In the audience are is his mother - a fading actress, her lover - a famous writer, and their friends and family. On stage is the woman Konstantin loves. Sparks of passion are ignited, and the soaring ambitions of this family and the people they love, are tested against the cold reality of life.

It has been said that Tabitha’s great-great-great-great-great-grandfather started a war, which would forever change China’s place in the world. But when she looks in the mirror, she can see herself belonging to both sides. 

Part history, part confession, A Westerner’s Guide to the Opium Wars wonders whether it’s worth holding onto the branches of the family tree.

Cellar Theatre, Sydney University

""The actual facts are so simple. I love you. You love me. You love Otto. I love Otto. Otto loves you. Otto loves me. There now! Start to unravel from there.""

‘Design For Living’ is Noel Coward’s 1931 comedy about a ménage-a-trois. Otto, Leo and Gilda love each other but can’t quite make their love work. From their bohemian life in Paris to the heights of their success in New York, we see these three characters try and navigate the difficult world of “love among the artists.”

This production aims to reveal the melancholic heart at the centre of Coward’s most controversial comedy.

THE BOOK OF JOB
7pm, 21-24 September

The Book of Job is one of the most fraught texts of our culture. It is a book from the old testament. It is a book about why we all suffer. It's about why you think “oh, jeez, I thought stuff was meant to be good but now it's bad, damn.” 

Also portions of it dont make sense. Despite this, truly astonishing poetry remains, rendering the text painfully compelling. We turned it into a play. It features God. God is a big man in the sky. He is a big dude and he is extremely scary. He has a big beard and is very very strong. I like God but I'm not sure he likes me :(

The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare
7pm, 31 August and 1-2 September
5:30pm, 3rd September 
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

“Hath not a Jew eyes?” 

In Venice, Antonio borrows 3000 ducats from Shylock, risking a pound of flesh if he forfeits.

In Belmont, a wealthy heiress Portia can neither choose or refuse love, but must marry whoever solves her dead father’s puzzle. 

But plans to elope, ill luck at sea, and a culture of prejudice forces these disparate narratives together, drawing Portia and Shylock into a terminal conflict that threatens the peace and order in Venice.

This streamlined production of ""The Merchant of Venice"" will interrogate the assumptions that precede one of William Shakespeare’s most compelling and controversial plays.

Summer and Smoke, by Tennessee Williams
7pm, 10 – 13 and 17 – 20 August
Cellar Theatre, within the University of Sydney

""What you have here is not the anatomy of a beast, but a man.""

A Minister’s daughter’s beliefs are thrown into question when a romance blooms with a young off-the-rails doctor. As she strives for something beyond the tangible, something greater than taste or touch or sight, her life and the lives of those she loves are thrown into chaos.

Appropriated to urban Sydney circa 2016 and heavily scored with a mix of classical and electro-dubstep music, Summer & Smoke reinvents a masterpiece by one of the great American playwrights to question the value of conservatism to a modern audience.

“Fucking and shooting are the same thing.”

Berlin, 2nd June, 1967. A student protest turns violent, and a student is shot and killed. The next ten years become a cycle of escalating violence; bombings, state brutality, murder, and psychological warfare, ending in 1977 with a plane hijacking and a stand off between the State and the student terrorists. 

Black Hands/Dead Section follows the rise and fall of the infamous Baader Meinhof gang, and the personal and political consequences of fighting violence with violence.

“…Marvellously young and marvellously beautiful. Youth and beauty are the only things worth having in this world…”

Inspired by the words of a new acquaintance, the young Dorian Gray gazes upon his freshly-painted portrait and wishes that the image might grow old while he might remain young. To the detriment of all around him, his wish is granted. 

A new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ by Nadia Bracegirdle, 'Dorian' explores obsession, love, vice, and what it means to place aesthetic ideals above all else.  In this decadent and carefree world is an underbelly of shame, fear, blackmail, and violence, which begs the question: how far are we willing to go to maintain our ideals?

This play calls itself “the story of you and your first great love”

Tender Napalm is a 2 hander involving a man and a woman exploring their relationship and their battles of love, compassion and grief.  Riding through waves of storytelling, fantasy and past memories they create armies against each other while deflecting the distance and pain growing in between them.  It studies the violence of love and association with hate and the bond created through grief.

Beat: (noun) the smallest unit of action in a scene; a shift in the action, thought, or emotion of the actor(s).

Beat: (noun) the basic unit of time in music, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level.

Beat is a show served in two parts, these parts playing consecutively over two weeks.

Part 1 explores silence as an essential element of drama and a by-product of human communication - does silence speak louder than words? How do humans communicate and miscommunicate? Does silence carry across culture?

SUDSusyd,SUDS Presents: JE NE SAIS QUOI,224,157,1191,0,157,1729,"SUDS Presents: JE NE SAIS QUOI

What is language but a construct? What is communication but a facilitator of relationships?

JE NE SAIS QUOI is an original bilingual play by Alana Cherry and Victoria Zerbst that traverses planes of time and space to crystallise answers to these questions. Art and philosophy intersect, lovers collide, words are exchanged, misshapen, and lost in this intellectual romp across language and culture. 

At its crux, it is a glimpse into the heart of human connections through the lives of six – a French couple, an Australian couple, and a pair of writers. But throw in a sarcastic waiter, a live band, a cabaret number, and a mime, and suddenly every character questions the nature of conversation and human interaction. Can their connections transcend our constructed barriers of communication? Qu’est-ce que c’est, l’amour?

Over the course of a single day, six characters’ lives are meshed and moulded, as they flirt with notions of romance, music, and Capital A Art.

SUDSusyd,SUDS Presents: Lady,153,109,918,0,109,1289,"The Sydney University Dramatic Society Presents: Lady

In a quiet country town, long ago, there lived a girl who wasn’t happy. Lady is stuck, labelled, bored. Washing clothes and leering men, marriage, children, routine – a life her mother accepts, her friend awaits. A life she must escape. 

Bathed in blood our heroine drowns, drifts and surfaces, desperate to emerge, rise from the depths of her nothing life and stand on her own feet. She won’t take less than greatness. With magic and lies she’ll get what she wants. If the sacrifices she makes on the way throw nature out of joint Lady only cares that it’s known the chaos was her doing. 

Witness the rise of a great woman who did much more than stand behind a great man. 

Lady is an original play, workshopped by cast, writer and director to be presented on stage for the first time as the opening show of SUDS' 2016 season.

But there’s something wrong with this romantic comedy, and it isn't just the hacky writing and the two dimensional female lead and the fact that these tropes are force-fed and familiar.  

Between ex-girlfriends and loud sisters and sharks with machine guns, Joe and Sierra manage to find something they can call their own romance. After all, Sierra really is Joe’s dream girl. It’s almost as if she was made for him. 

Manic Pixie Dream World is a new play exploring the stereotypes and tropes of the romantic comedy and the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

SUDSusyd,SUDS PRESENTS: Werewolves,204,23,352,0,23,602,"Welcome to Drottingham. A town unburdened by famine, sickness or lack of industry. Drottingham exists stagnant, as it has for centuries - that is, until Prof. Northumberland is pronounced dead. He leaves behind a valuable piece of land, but no lawful heir to make claim to it. According to the traditions of the town, ownership of the land is to be determined by seven noble townsfolk, who run and administer its essential industries.

But Drottingham has a secret. It is home to a pair of werewolves, hidden under the guise of two of these townsfolk. These two werewolves will be present in the town meeting, trying to disguise themselves as villagers, and they will not rest until the town is theirs.

But who can stop them?

Through a series of rounds, characters will be eliminated from the show, voted off by the audience. Working for the good of the town, YOU will try to spot the two individuals who you believe to be the werewolves, taking note of sly looks, shifty accusations and general wolf-like behaviour. Neither the audience, nor the actors will know who the two werewolves are. Each night the characters will draw a card out of a hat and play that role for the rest of the show.

‘Werewolves’ is an interactive, improvised, “choose-your-own-adventure,” murder mystery. Can you spot the werewolves before it’s too late?

""O hell, to choose love by another's eyes!”

Helios. Demetrius. Hermia. Lysander.

Four lovers flee into the forest, away from their parents and a society that says they can't be together. As bonds are broken, family and friendship are shown to be as flawed as the standards they are built on. Family can be escaped, can values?

“This same progeny of evils comes from our dissension.”

Puck. Titania. Oberon. Theseus. Hippolyta. Egeus.

In a constant fight for dominance, games are played with the mortals and forest as pawns. Power can be won, but is it worth it when you tear apart those beneath you?

“Never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it.”

Bottom. Quince. Flute. Snout. Snug. Starveling.

A patch of rude mechanicals come together to rehearse a play, but the deeper they delve into the forest, the harder this proves. Can you remain true in world that has forgotten how to understand you? 

As these narratives interweave, the ability for us to engage; with ourself, with others, and with the values of others, is called into question. Why do we struggle to understand the world beyond ourself? Is this why we’re homophobic or selfish? Do we allow ourselves to treat it as a dream?

The magic of theatre in Shakespeare’s Midsummer captivates the imagination of its audiences; infinitely complex yet poetically simple, the play seeks out a world attainably beautiful. A Midsummer Night's Dream will leave its audiences from all walks of life with the elusive question of how we understand theatre, and how we understand each other— If you engage that is, it could just be a dream.

It’s been 125 years of small budgets and big ideas, cheap wine and rich theatre, drama and politics on stage and off, old stories and new works, short rehearsal periods and long tech runs, dingy venues and bright talents, and everything in between that has made the Sydney University Dramatic Society and its particular brand of student theatre as vibrant, addictive and resonant as it remains today.

In 2015, our 126th year, the Sydney University Dramatic Society will be celebrating and looking back on 125 years of student theatre as we return to the Great Hall to restage one of the society’s first productions, Aeschylus’ Agamemnon.

Join us to celebrate this extraordinary milestone, and the wonderful history of SUDS. 

--------------------------

Agamemnon returns from war with a prophetess in tow. He did terrible things when he was away. His wife Klytaimestra knows. She will have her vengeance.

It is beautiful and it is terrible. It is wrong and it is so, so right.

Everything spirals out from this moment: one of the great stories of Western mythology, a feast of language and violent spectacle that climaxes in the rebirth of civilisation.
Before, there was the fall of the Titans, the fall of Thyestes, the Trojan War and the Odyssey. After, there will be the hunt of the Furies, the verdict of the gods, and the foundation of justice. At the heart of it all lies Agamemnon.

You know the drill, all closed doors stay closed, don’t touch what ain’t yours, and don’t you dare try and change the playlist because Gillian will eviscerate you. Message me first about any plus ones—if someone’s not on the list they won’t be let in!

Better so, ever wondered what it’s like to be a part of Australia’s largest professionally focused student organisation? Apply now to become a subcommittee member for the Financial Management Association of Australia (FMAA)! 

The FMAA was established in 1990 to foster business connections and recognise the importance of networking. To this day, that same objective still echoes through the organisation, connecting students with our sponsors through various networking opportunities. 

Why the FMAA Subcommittee? 
Whether you’re a seasoned FMAA member or simply a student entering your first year of university, becoming a subcommittee member of the FMAA will provide you with endless opportunities and experiences. These range from helping the organisation at our keynote events, to maintaining close contact with executive members. In addition, you will be able to develop your teamwork, communication and organisational skills. Such skills are highly sought after by employers in the corporate world. Having said all of this, please bear in mind that such a role is not simply a walk in the park. With every opportunity comes a lot of responsibility, and as such, this is by no means an easy role. 

Recruitment Process 
We will be holding a number of coffee meet-ups with applicants throughout the first few weeks of the new semester. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of your character and motivations for joining the FMAA. Finally, we will be holding interviews with applicants in the middle of the semester.


UPDATE: Applications for the 2017 FMAA subcommittee have officially opened! Please apply by filling out this form: https://form.jotform.co/70550834005852
The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on Friday 7 April. Please note that this form is separate from the Mailing List you may have previously filled out, so if you do not submit this new form we unfortunately will not receive your application. 

We have enjoyed meeting everyone who has come to postering and our coffee meet ups over the past few weeks! Please remember that although applications have officially opened, postering and coffee meet ups will continue next week, and execs will continue to take attendance of those who are present. Additionally, please note that the FMAA places a strong emphasis on commitment and cohesiveness with the team, both of which are primarily displayed through attendance at postering and interaction with executives. If as an applicant you don't attend postering or coffee meet ups you will unfortunately be at a disadvantage in seeking to gain a place on the subcommittee, and are unlikely to be granted an interview if you have never attended one of these sessions.   

The date for recruitment interviews has been tentatively set for the evening of Monday 10 April, so please attempt to keep this free and comment any availabilities you may have in the provided space in the form. 

We look forward to seeing you all at the remaining postering and coffee meet up sessions!",2017-03-30T18:00:00+1100

We'll start with tables of 10. When you get slapped, instead of stacking cups, you'll hold on to the empty one you just drank. Once the game ends, the five people with the fewest cups will progress to the next round.
***If you get stuck in the cage, and get slapped 3 times in a row, you are knocked out***
All the rules of the game can be hard to explain, so your friendly SUEUA exec will be making an instructional video in the next day or so. Fair warning, most of us will be playing on the day. Come at me.

SU.Engineers,SUEUA Sees USYD Revue,10,29,10,0,29,78,"If you're new to uni, or if you've been living under a rock during your time here, you might not be aware of the faculty and identity revues that are run every year. Engineering has a proud history as the oldest (so I'm told) continuously running (deregistration doesn't matter so long as the show goes on) faculty revue at USYD. In recent history, this has been largely due to the inspiring leadership of our 2016 director, Mattie Longfield!

Each year, the best acts and sketches are selected from the faculty and identity revues, provided with a solid injection of cash, and combined together to make one super revue! Engo revue made the cut with one of our sketches this year, and Mattie has been attending rehearsal every Thursday (yes, instead of partying) to do us proud. 

To support our friend, and as an excellent excuse to enjoy a drop or two on a thursday night, we'll be attending the revue, preceded by some cheeeeap drinks outside PNR. Pick up tickets here: https://www.seymourcentre.com/events/event/2017-sydney-uni-revue/ Obviously, SUEUA does not recommend taking more drinks into the Seymour Centre for during the show, or heckling the performers - these behaviours would certainly be frowned upon.

What - USYD Revue, starring our lovely friend Mattie
Where - Seymour Centre, after drinks at PNR

SU.Engineers,Beer 'n' Bangers 2017: Into the Woods,342,345,484,0,345,1516,"Once upon a time there was a party that the engineers held under the immortal bronze flesh statue of Peter Nicol Russell. Each year a new cohort of degenerates would partake in increasingly daring feats under the orange glow of the King. Then, everything changed when the Seymour drywall puncher attacked. We’ve had a few years of different locations, and according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way Beer ’n’ Bangers should be allowed to be held at PNR again. But whispers have trickled down the grapevine of PNR - whispers of an event so off the rails not even an extremely high coefficient of friction could keep this hype-train on track. It’s the night that’s going to be litter than lit and turnter than Joey Oregano at the Newtown hotel.

It’s Beer ’n’ Bangers 2017: Into the Woods.

Welcome to Engineering’s biggest sausage fest of the year, not to mention the all you can eat BBQ. We’re taking the event back to its roots, its rightful home in PNR courtyard. This year’s theme is Into the Woods, which, like Rule Zero, is open to interpretation. So we want to see your sauciest Cinderellas and raciest Rumpelstiltskins in a wild night that will leave you more cooked than Hansel and Gretel in the witches oven.

What: Beer ’n' Bangers: Into the Woods
Where: PNR Courtyard, baby. We back!
When: Thursday 13th of April, 6:30 pm
How much: 35/Early Bird

SU.Engineers,Roaring 20s - Engineering Ball 2016,334,272,291,0,272,1169,"Ladies and Gentlemen,

The SUEUA executive is proud to present our biggest and favourite event of the year: Engineering Ball! Faculty balls are your chance to dress up and let loose with all your friends, be a little fancy, and ignore all the consequences: because it's right before midsem!

This year Engineering will be returning to the Ivy Ballroom, for a 3 course meal, unlimited drinks and live music. The theme for this year is Roaring 20s! Get dressed up and ready to stay a little more classy than we might be used to. Protest the prohibition, and learn how to dance without grinding (only for the first part of the night, don't worry), all while eating and drinking in absolute style and the greatest company. Price of your ticket obviously includes entry into the rest of The Ivy to party into the morning after the Ball is over.

Historically, our ball has been both better AND cheaper than all the other faculties', and this year is no exception. This year, in the finest venue we've ever had the pleasure of occupying, we bring to you our most generous drinks package ever, an incredible menu (updates to come), and the JazzSoc 18-piece big band to soothe us through dinner and swing us into the afterparty. The pricing is:
Member: $85
Access: $95
Non-access: $105

Tickets will be sold this Friday at midday. Engineering Ball has a tendency to sell out on the first day, with lines known to stretch around PNR. Make sure to get in early to ensure you get a ticket!

Please note that this event is 18+, and your ID will be required to get into the Ivy.

This year's ball is being sponsored by our friends and colleagues at Accenture, and we're excited to hear briefly from one of their representatives during our event. You can check out opportunities with accenture here: https://www.accenture.com/au-en/careers/graduate-home
